        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">What really is going on behind-the-scenes we are looking at through the 5 senses? Why is there this feeling that there is more to the story than just appearances. Who indeed has set this up and is pulling the strings. Is it really just a group of somebodies that is in charge? If this is the case, then is the God thing really a hoax after all? There are those who believe that to be the true essence of the scenario. Fortunately for the good of all, that is not the Truth.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The Truth is that there are multiple levels of activity behind what appears to be a play of incredible magnitude. Who then is writing the lines for the characters and what is the point of the script? Would it be a surprise to inform you that you are writing the lines and until you can figure out a point to the script, there is none? If that is the case, then which of the individuals on the planet can figure one out? Well, indeed there is a focused group that has decided that they would like to put forth their point in the script. There is just one problem with this, they have decided to put forth a focus within the play that is not in harmony with the Creator of the stage and the theatre that this play is to be performed upon. In fact, the plan this group has in mind has a great surprise at the end for the audience and the actors on the stage. The intend to destroy the audience, the actors, the stage and the theatre.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Since the Creator of this theatre likes this particular theatre and thinks of it as a pet project, this idea doesn’t appeal to Him at all. Since He is not in the business of standing in the way of the creative presentations that produced within its confines, then He is hoping that the audience will decide to make changes of their own. There is a type of presentation that involves participation of the audience other than just sitting and observing. The theatre entrepreneur is wondering that if the play being presented become obnoxious enough to the audience, will they simply walk away and withdraw their attention? This would then allow the cast and its directors to destroy themselves, but then the theatre owner does not want this property destroyed along with them. He is hoping that the audience will come up with some other solution. Perhaps there could be audience participation that would perhaps introduce some new characters that would create lines of script of their own. If a new story line could be introduced with characters that could change the ending, then the performance could be a comedy or a mystery or a love story rather than a tragedy. Maybe, audience participation could indeed create a whole new genre of experience. Instead of depicting repetition of experiences already known, could the audience in the intensity of desire change the story line, come up with a creative scenario that would encompass possibilities not yet experienced? Why not? The greater the desire for change, the greater the opportunity for creative new boundary expanding story themes. Within the spontaneity of group focus, without the academic control of leadership with an intended purpose, conception outside of ordinary themes is not only possible, it is probable.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">To what purpose is is this discussion being instigated? Is it time that you awaken to your responsibility to change the destination of the path you are now being pushed to take. It is far past the stage of leading you. It is at the stage of pushing you. It is at the stage where resistance cannot be successful therefore you are going to have to accomplish this by some other means. A way must be literally created that will bring about a solution. Nothing that you have done before will accomplish a change in this situation. Those who have brought you to this point know your current human nature so well that every possibility you can think of has been blocked. Every cell of resistance is well known by them and is allowed to exist because it has a purpose in their plan. These will be used as graphic examples of what they will not allow.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Now you must come into the understanding that there is a passage through this experience for mankind, but you must move into a creative stance, not a resistive posture. This is not what is expected of you based on your past modes of experience. I can assure you that your history has been analyzed and studied by minds and computer model to the point that you are known to an extent you cannot even imagine. Every reactive scenario has been dissected to the cellular level and restrictive actions planned for each of them. You are faced with the possibility of your extinction unless you can make a cosmic leap to a level of creative imagination that will completely nullify those plans. Have you not computers of your own? Can you not band into creative discussion groups and ask for entry into the mind of that which created you? “Where two or more of you are gathered together in my Name (within the focused desire for harmonious understanding), there am I also.”</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Cries and begging to be relieved of the situation by God, or Jesus, Buddha or Mohammed will not do it. You have allowed this evil to descend upon you and so it is you, individually and collectively, that must take it upon yourselves to conceive this solution. A new consciousness change must take place within you. Not all of humanity will choose to participate. There will be some that will hide their heads in blame and grovel in victimhood. So be it. Let them. You have no time to recruit among them, for what of creativity could they offer? This is a clarion call to the consciousness of those with the strength of character to stand up within their own conscious awareness and decide this situation shall not be allowed to continue to its planned completion. Even those who are in the midst of that abominable plan have no idea that the end is indeed to be annihilation. Unfortunately, it is not only planned to be annihilation of the people and the planet, but realms beyond imagination.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">How shall it be done? How can a change come about in the midst of such a lack of understanding of who and what you are? Now, while there is yet time, before the noose tightens, movement about the planet is yet possible. Groups shall come together to stretch their conscious awareness, to invoke the aid of the highest of sources of knowledge to assist them in conceiving a new way of expiring manifested existence. This must not be copied from any other experience. It must be literally a conceptual leap, not in its entirety, but in invocation of the beginning framework of such an experience. This is not a process that can be spelled out. It is shadowy in the beginning as it is conceived as a possibility, and so it should be. Known boundaries of experience must be transcended. A super-human assignment? Indeed, but not at all impossible. Out of challenge born of desire and necessity comes the conception of that which is different.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Has mankind on this planet been presented with this opportunity before? Indeed, but each time he reverted to known strategies. Now is has been of his creation that this situation exists. It has been his task to make this leap and so he has now made it so that it must be undertaken or face the possibility he may cease to exist. All of this is his own doing. Mankind has no one else to blame, so it must a 180 degree turn from past refusal to take on the whole project, to taking it on with resolve and dedication.</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">The concept of power has within it the inherent understanding of effort. The concept of power has within it the inherent understanding of effort as force. Since thought attracts, you have brought to you the experience of effort, force and power. There are other experiences available that do not use this concept. Rocketry projects are an example. Your resources are used to effort one rocket and its payload into the orbit of this planet and then beyond. Yet you are visited by beings of other planets that enter and leave your planet’s gravitational field without wasteful effort. Does this prove to you that there are other ways to accomplish movement without such wasteful and dangerous methods? The search for answers to this question intrigues the mind. The are many that know these possibilities exist, but are unable to envision the answers without the need of using great effort to resist what they envision ties them to the planet. It is not the gravitational field that ties them to the planet. It is the interactivity of thought acting upon thought that eludes them. They know that their thoughts can influence the outcome of an experiment. However the concept that thought once projected can be released to interact within itself and that it can produce an outcome beyond a controlled (desired) outcome is not understood. The need to control, observe and. To prove the process prevents them from reaching into new realms of understanding. What is lacking is the ability to trust that the process can only proceed within positive outcomes once it is released to act within and upon itself. Thought released to act upon itself will return in manifestation glorified and in a form more magnificent than the limited focused mind can imagine.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Now the challenge comes to those who desire to be the instruments of changing the negative plans for the destiny of this planet. Can you expand your consciousness to encompass the process that lies just beyond your “grasp”? It will be necessary for you to begin with the basic desire of participating within a new paradigm experience. However, to leave the known and desire to venture into the unknown requires the courage to release what you feel is the advancement this “civilization” has made from its stone age beginnings into modern technological comfort for many on this planet. Do you know that the word civilization is synonymous with slavery? In order to accomplish this experience, it required giving up the freedom of personal choice in order that group organization might have precedence. Beyond the family, no organization is necessary. Personal responsibility is the keynote of freedom. Cooperation is a natural phenomenon as long as the need to control is absent. The need to control is a learned activity that becomes habitual through the experience of it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">How does one transcend this habitual activity when it is deeply ingrained at a planetary level? It has now reached a point that in and of himself, man cannot break this addiction. The adversaries know this well. They are sure that humanity cannot change it. How then will it occur as the primary starting point of the shift to a new paradigm of experience? It can be done by understanding that thought focused and released can indeed act within itself and upon itself. Though it sounds simplistic, and indeed in reality it is simplistic, it is a powerful tool. In order for this process to work, there are some criteria that must be present. Since it is a process of Divine Order, it must have at its intentional level the desire to co-ordinate within this perpetual process. The purpose of it must be conceived with the focus of the continued evolvement of those who will benefit from its inception through the outward movement of its spheres of influence. The intent of its purpose is the key to its success of coordination with and within the flow of Divine Order. If this is reduced to a mathematical formula, then its inclusion can not cause a change in any of the Divine formulas that allow the balance of the whole to exist in harmony. Thought thinking within itself would know if it was acceptable or not. That is the reason the opposition cannot take advantage of this process. Purity of intent to harmonize as the motive is a primary prerequisite. The outlining thought must be specific only in the intent of purpose. It must provide direction of purpose allowing the thought thinking process to proceed into Divine Order by releasing it in total trust knowing it is accomplished in what you call etheric levels and will then manifest into this recognizable reality using the available triggers for appropriate interaction.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">How can you know that this actually will accomplish the desired results and is not just another ploy of the opposition to keep you controlled? How you heard of this on your media reports? Is anyone within the approved world of communication touting this as your energies into the salvaging of your sexy bodies and in your humanitarian thoughts for the suffering multitudes, as you have another bite of your steak dinner at the restaurant, or at least another convenient hamburger on your way home from your unproductive labors at the computer keyboard. The process through which you receive this information does use the wonders of your computer. It is a demonstration of thought interacting with itself with the addition of focus. It is the focus of your intent that will initiate the process that you desire. Then thought focused purposeful intent will complete itself in magnificence through the energy of your faith and trust. Firmly holding to the knowing the etheric form of it was completed in less than the blinking of your eye will it to manifest into 3rd dimensional reality. The computer-like processes of the Creation are indeed endowed with quickness. The again the ball shall be returned to your court for more to be done within your dimension.</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">This makes the contact between the extension (spirit in body) and its Soul (focused source) more difficult. This is not the whole of the intent. This allows for the possibility of the separation of the two energies. Intricate manipulations of this extension energy must be accomplished in order for this to be a possibility. The “capture” of this Soul energy is for the purpose of causing a break in the chain of energies that extend from the matrix of the Soul. It is the belief of those doing this that it will cause a breaking down of the positive energies that comprise the basic building blocks of Creation. In other words, they perceive that causing a break in the return flow of this energy back to its source will cause a disruption in the larger combined pattern of the Galactic matrix. The conception of this group of separatists is that a chain reaction will happen allowing for chaos to such a degree that their focus can reorganize this chaos into their own matrix. This is quite an arrogant and ambitious undertaking. The plan includes many more quite fantastic steps to follow through to its completion. This is not a plan conceived on a moment’s notice. It is one that has been put together over eons of time in your counting. However, since their plans are counter to the controlling parameters within which Creation has come into manifested experience, they are unable to take advantage of the processes that also act as failsafe guards available to the Creation for the purpose of preventing this planned procedure from causing such an event.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Your logical question is how has this rebellion been allowed to continue to this point? The freewill aspect is what has been exploited as the basis for their ability to manipulate humanity to be the vehicle of their power. Yours is the exact state of consciousness to serve their purpose. You are malleable enough to be influenced into desiring change when pressure is applied to the Soul/extension connection, and change is exactly what they want. At each critical juncture in the previous cycles, mankind has been influenced to change what was present rather than to desire an entirely new experience. Within the cycles of energy that maintain manifested Creation at the various dimensions, there are critical points which allow for changing the vibratory parameters of these dimensions. There is within this opportunity ways that they have worked out to create a downward spiral into heavier energy rather than lifting of vibration as was intended. This can only happen when the mass consciousness of that vibratory level of planetary experience has its focus on experiences at the lowest level of that dimension. As we approach another of these opportunities, you can observe where the mass consciousness is with regard to what you call ethics and character by considering the role models that are currently popular. However, there is a risk for them in their process. There is a point at which their restrictive pressure of controlling the thought processes of the mass consciousness of the planet can backfire and cause exactly the opposite of what they have planned. This will cause them to miss the opportunity of the final dimensional vibratory change needed for completion of their plans.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">They have been successful in their use of various techniques enabling them to greatly weaken the Soul/human extension connection. Because of technology and greater understanding of the nature of human experience, techniques have been developed that indicate success in the process of separating extension and Soul. There is considerable over confidence in the success of the techniques used on individuals as being applicable to large groups of a experimental successes have them quite intoxicated and already soaring the completion of their divergent goals. (However, it is possible to reverse those procedures and reunite the energies into wholeness again, though the complete healing of these beings that have been used as guinea pigs will require much help. The Grace of the Creator shall be showered upon those individuals to assure the Soul matrix is not distorted.)</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The implications of this picture are many, but do not despair for in the knowledge of this, you can plainly see that you are not alone in the healing of this situation. It is just that freewill is at the essence of how you got yourselves into this situation and it will the use of freewill that you will desire to finally do something drastic enough that will get you through it. You have used change to get you out before and it only altered the situation, it did not resolve it completely. In this case, the scenario is such that it is literally “do or die” to borrow your vernacular. Within the proper choice of focus lies your salvation. Smile, you are on the “winning side.”</p>',

This is a time in which you cannot leave this change in the hands of others. It is too great a responsibility to e left to a few. You must make your contribution in order to be assured that it shall be accomplished and that you shall be included in the multitude that make this a reality.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">To accomplish this, first you must open your eyes and see what is happening all around you. You must then come to the unpleasant understanding that you have allowed this to occur because overwhelming methodology of deception influenced you and you resisted becoming involved though taking any personal responsibility in changing it. Careful remembering of past intuitive feelings bring you to the truth. You are now and have been aware that something sinister is present. In all honesty you lacked the courage to look at what it might be because of the implications of what it could involve personally. Courage to do this has come though the change of your attitude. The magnitude of the implication of what the planners of this situation are capable of doing to your personal future and that of family and friends has allowed your desire to know to overwhelm your reluctance. This then leads to the necessity of considering its large implication, the planet and its inhabitation’s as a whole. This process has brought you to the point of looking directly into the face of truth. Unfortunately, it is not some religious or esoteric concept that is the “truth that will set you free” but what has been your desire to avoid at all cost. What you must understand is that this truth is about a situation that could end your earthly experience in extremely unpleasant circumstances, and places your eternal existence in jeopardy. The stakes are extremely high and the circumstances are dire indeed!</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This is not a time to hide in your usual excuse of “what can one person do?” A large number of “one persons” can accomplish a great deal. Becoming “cannon fodder” is not the solution. It is required that you become a much more subtle influence. Learn one truth now. Subtle energy is powerful and most powerful energy is subtle. Your bible says, “In the beginning was the word” but words are thoughts spoken out loud, an inaccurate translation. In the beginning was thought! That is the subtle energy that we are asking you to employ. Simply change the focus of your thought. Do not allow yourself to dwell upon the hours of what is planned for you, but turn your thought to what it is that you would prefer to experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You are trained by their methodology to think only about the programmed thoughts of acquiring things, others opinions, self directed thoughts through addiction to TV, movies and Soul jarring music. Last but not least, pursuit of sexual experience, be it in or out of monogamous relationships. There is also the mind-boggling profusion of religious entities to further lead you from the personal quest of understanding the connection to the source of your presence on this planet in the first place. I can assure you that Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed had nothing to do with it. It is not that these beings did not exist, nor that they were not here to attempt to give you guidance in getting through this dilemma, but the messages they brought were distorted long ago. Neither did they come here to “get you out” by your belief in their existence, past or present. They cam to teach you that you must get yourself through this by taking personal responsibility and creating through thought a new planetary experience. In this way only, will you be able to move through this painful experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You accept this responsibility by making a personal commitment between you and the creative energy that focused you through thought into this existence. You will know how to participate in creating what will replace this living nightmare with a new experience! How? You search for it through your desire to know and to participate in its creation. Then through seemingly miraculous coincidence, how to participate shall become known to you. The critical point of the process is in making the commitment within your own awareness that the most important thing is participating in the creation of an experience that is 180 degrees opposite what is not planned to be your final earthly sojourn.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The evidence of the necessity to do this surrounds you in irritable profusion. You need only to open your eyes, consider the changes in your personal freedoms that are happening in quick succession and listen to (hear) the researched evidence in both spoken and written presentations on your radios, internet and in books. Very soon those will no longer be available to you, leaving only word of mouth, so it is imperative that you respond to this information. You are encouraged to react only through your change of attitude and in your commitment to become a part of this subtly powerful movement. There will not be an Armageddon as suggested in their version of your bible. It shall be a replacement of their planned world through shifting the focus of the awareness of the beings on this planet toward that which is desired rather than that which is being forced upon them. It shall be individual inner change that shall conquer the outer forces that plan to control your very essence of self-awareness. Upon the acceptance of this clarion call lies the future of your survival and the experiences that wait for you within eternity.</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">Remember that earth is a projection of thought and thought is self-aware and interacts within itself to greater or lesser degrees. Would earth think to a greater or a lesser degree? That is a question to contemplate.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This is a moment in which to be aware of the changing of the guard. It seems that the destiny of the planet has been wrestled from the control of its inhabitants, as it would appear the control of the Republic of the U.S.A. has been taken from its people. Movement within the conscious awareness of the inhabitants present has begun. These levels of consciousness are subtle and they are powerful. Notice of this change in consciousness is not at a vibratory level that will alert the negative forces. Its momentum builds within the subtle powerful planes of energy forces that hold this planet in focus. It is thought interacting within itself. It is acting in concert as a changing perception of the mass consciousness that is similar to a natural shedding process. Like the snake, there is in itchiness that is being felt. This process allows for a time of vulnerability and danger from enemies for it is an internal process. The snake indeed goes within an available den because during this internal process it becomes literally blind. All focus is within itself as the process goes through its formation of a new outside experience for it has outgrown its ability to continue as it is. Even the covering of the eyes is changed so that it sees its world anew. Only the death of the snake can prevent this cyclical occurrence, thus it takes great care during this process. This is an apt analogy for our consideration of the progress of mankind through what appears to be a dilemma of great proportion. Just as the fetus grows too large for the womb and must give up its current experience and adventure out into a completely new environment, there are guiding examples throughout nature to suggest this process is a natural phase of manifested life experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The separation of man from nature through the herding of them into metropolitan areas is not an accident. It has been used many times to suppress individual power to control the experience of life. Closely compacted form is more easily pushed to and fro in the effort of moving individuals into experiences that are contrary to their natural desires toward individual responsibility in choosing their life experience. This herding smothers the natural desires and opens the psyche to influence by the confusion that is drawn within the totality of the being. There is a fundamental call within each for balance. The lack of ability to choose experiences freely causes a distortion of energy pattern that brings intuitional discomfort unending streams of unfulfilling pursuits by those who would change the destiny of this planetary experience. However, there are ingrained patterns of experience that are reminiscent of the skin shedding process that cannot be distorted. The negative forces have their time schedule that must be met. The timing of this process of human “skin changing” is not one that they are privy to know no matter how. They analyze and re-analyze the human experience from their perspective. Can you know realize that Thought  thinking within itself has created fail-safe checks that prevent destruction if at all possible. Again we are faced with that one element that can put on hold even the fail- safe checks and balances. Freewill! Each has personal responsibility for the use of this great gift of the Creator. He has confidence that fragments of Himself may enjoy taking themselves to the edge of extinction for the fun of the adventure. But, just as in your action movies, (a depiction of this underlying adventurous focus) through perfect timing the hero moves through the scenario with hardly a scratch of at least nothing that can not be healed. Sometimes you miss the point of the movies.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You are now at the critical place in the script. It is time to write in the shift of momentum from the bad guys to the hero so that he can experience that unexpected twist of the story line that allows for his harrowing escape leaving the bad guys holding the bag. Let us hope that this is not a Superman or secret agent adventure in which again there is no end to the bad guy and another adventure between them is waiting in the wings. You have already experienced those scripts. Again you have missed the point of the movies. Do you feel the sense of satisfaction of evil vanquished when you leave that genre of movie? That is the point of it. To always leave you with the idea that evil remains no matter what you do. Were not your experiences in Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm outward depictions of this same frustrating movie? All wars have this same result; it has just not been part of the plan until recently to flaunt it so plainly for you to see. Your ability to discern and react is being tested over and over. Why else would items of what is being “sanctioned” (withheld) from innocent people in Iraq be published in your newspapers. What do these items for personal use of individual innocent people have to do with prevention of war preparations? These lists were published worldwide. How do you think the people, who uphold their degenerate president who is instigating this, are thought of by the rest of the world? A new movie genre is being released now. In these your people are being held accountable. These depict surges of justifiable retribution (terrorism) and are being planted in the minds of those of other countries. Their ideal of America as the Light of the world is being destroyed by your diplomacy of arrogance toward other countries’ right of self determination. These punishments are seen as appropriate by them for they are unable to resist on a larger scale to this injustice. The disturbances used as excuses to interfere within the borders of other counties are made to appear that there is necessity to intervene for the good of the citizens. These contrived situations are a hoax, created by subversive groups like the CIA. The resultant aftermath of your American intervention is hardly what you are told it is. Guilt because for being used as a tool will not serve to end this charade. Do not waste your time on it. Resolve to be a part of the solution in order that this error in perception maybe rectified.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The wake-up call is being sounded and the internal intuitional agitation to shed the skin of this deceptive controlled experience has begun in earnest. This time of choosing to move with the flow of Creation or to remain stuck within the hoax is upon all of humanity. Education, as it is known, is not an advantage. It is within each self-awareness that this process will take place. All are equal in opportunity in this process. Believe that! Purity of response outweighs educational degrees. Those who know the least of what is going on will hear first. You have been educated into the deception that provides the grease upon the wheels of their plans. You have been fooled into supporting them as they carried forth their plans that so far have been focused upon the uneducated and those unable to oppose the power you are giving the manifested evil ones through consent by believing in their lies.</p>',

To this add telegraph, telephone, satellites plus music and sporting events all beginning in childhood at the earliest possible moment. Where is there, within this onslaught of mind boggling confusion of distractions, time or desire to contemplate within silence anything but a replay of these experiences? The conscious awareness tries to clear out the clutter of this overload so that contact can be made with an inner awareness and contemplation can begin of how and why you are within this experience. This is a process that goes on quite naturally, except when the conscious half of this combination is overloaded with stimuli. It should be immediately apparent to the reader that this is the case in modern North American/European parts of the world. Furthermore, it is spreading to the more affluent elements around the planet. Once exposed to this mind stifling process, it appears to be relaxing. It is not relaxing, it is mind surprising! The creative, self-contemplating portions of the awareness are being shut down. The more the experience is repeated, the more of an addiction is acquired. Instead of enjoying mentally stimulating experiences, these are experiences as disquieting and downright irritating. Thus you see the joggers with their wired up ears listening rather than contemplating their own thoughts. Somehow, they must stay connected to their addiction to distraction. If not radios or tapes, then it is car phones to stay connected so one can pontificate with their “friends.”</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Can you, reading this, separate yourself from the distraction process to contemplate and absorb descriptions of the wondrous fantasy land existence you are experiencing? Where is what you call reality within a world that is mostly pretend? When you look in truth at the information you trade daily through your computer connections, how much of it is indeed concrete manifested reality? Is the money transferred from one account to another actually stacks of bills? Do that many stacks of denominations of money actually exist? Where are there bank safes to house trillions of dollars? Wake up! You are dreaming! Ah, but if you wake up you will have to face the solid reality that you have been used, and that is too frightening to contemplate! How long do you think this dream bubble can go on expanding before it breaks of its own thins or just perhaps there are ones that will enjoy pricking the bubble? Would it not be best to wake up early and begin to dream a new ending to the nightmare in disguise that you are now experiencing? Can you do that? Of course you can. It is your dream. That you have been programmed to dream a particular scenario can only continue as long as you allow it. There is something called lucid dreaming in which you awaken to an awareness that you are dreaming in which you awaken to an awareness that you are dreaming, then you can stop at the degree of consciousness, observe yourself dreaming and change the scenario of the dream. If you are being chased, create a safe hiding place, have the pursuer fall into a hole, or a train come between you, and you escape.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You have been lulled into a dream state by the distraction of your conscious awareness in order to separate you from your self-aware state (which is the state in which you can observe your dream process). You can correlate this into an awareness that will you to reclaim the severed connection to both parts of your total awareness. In truth, your intuitive awareness is beginning now to become awake to the truth of this information. Do you know that you have the power within yourself to encourage this feeling and come out of the unnatural state of distraction into full awareness? This waking process can allow you to avoid the fear and panic that you think facing it might bring, and instead give you an ability to discover yourself as a focus of energetic and create expression. It will not awaken the “brute caveman” reaction you might expect. Instead a contemplate ability to focus upon solutions will come forth that will replace what was formally sensed as an undefeatable force and an unsolvable situation. This force was smothering you in a deepening dream reality that you will discover does not even exist. It may appear so to the five senses, but you perceive that beyond those lies a potential that supersedes what you have known before. It is the same potential that pulls entrepreneurs into successful businesses and explorers toward unknown places. It has an enticing intuitional call that pulls them from the town, to desire an experience that is unknown and holds such a vibration of potential of success that it cannot be resisted. Many hear the call, but few choose to answer it. That does not mean that it does not exist. The success stories are proof enough of its existence.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is hoped that this information for you to contemplate apart from your normal mesmerizing existence. Is there something beyond this enticingly humdrum existence that could be even more rewarding? Indeed there is!</p>',

Instead they watch through detached wisdom knowing that then ending will be a positive one, but with concern for how many awareness points shall move with the ascending transformation process and how many will be left behind to be shepherded through the process of another opportunity. It shall be a great relief to these when the Earth experience in this particular focus will have been completed. Just how it shall all come together has become of major interest, for indeed you have created your own grand and spectacular stage play. The story line is quite unique, something like “The Perils of Pauline of the Galaxy”.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is noted that the terms of Universe and galaxy are tossed about with abandon and you find yourself puzzled in attempting to correlate these into a meaningful 3rd dimensional understanding. In truth this is not quite possible, but we shall make an attempt at doing so. Galaxy refers to the flow of manifested reality around a center of focus. Universe refers to the focused intent of coagulation of energy that in your terminology lies behind and supports this manifested reality. There are Universal Laws that allow for the creation and maintenance of this galaxy. Since you are part of this Galaxy (you have named Milky Way), then if you are to experience in harmony within it, you must live within these laws. In this case, you are like children playing pin the tail on the donkey, for these laws have been withheld from you and you are left to discover them by trial and error. Right now, you are far into the error process. Is this how it has been ordained for you to learn them? INDEED NOT! The blindfold has been deliberately placed upon you and you have been fooled into thinking that you have no right to remove it. The blindfold is the game of deception in which you are enticed to look where the magician deliberately presents action for you to watch while he supports it with motions you do not perceive. Your attention is focused on what you think is the only action.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Fortunately not all the audience is fooled. They watch you and wonder why you do not see the processes the magicians use. The fact is they wonder why you are now at a stage where you only perceive his spotlighted action and do not even see the magician. You are so mesmerized that indeed the supporting motions to the actions are no longer even hidden. They proceed all around him on the stage and still you see neither of them. How is this possible? By hypnotizing the conscious mind!</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Luckily there is another part of the mind that is beyond this conscious thinking. Your psychologists call it your subconscious mind. They have painted it as holding your perception of Life hostage because it is full of dark, horrible experiences perpetrated on you by well meaning but abusive parents. As a result you fear it and block it from participating in your experience of Life. Why is the word Life capitalized? Because that is the purpose of your experience on this planet! You are alive, that is aware of experiencing this Life energy moving through you and played out on the screen of your observing ego mind. Ah, the ego, the devil of your existence, or so you have been led to believe. Anyone acting in a pushy manner is being egotistical. His ego has him by the necktie and is causing him to misbehave according to the imposed social norms. He is controlled by his evil sub-conscious acting out through his ego and he must be brought down a peg and that awful ego humbled into compliance. The successful businessman is successful because his inflated ego runs amuck over others and snatches success from the hands of the deserving underlines, etc., etc. Need I go on painting this picture of slight of mind?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What then is the true picture? If there is no ego, there will be no awareness of the manifested experience! The ego is your tap recorder. It is observer of your thoughts, wants, needs and desires. It takes these thoughts in a type of robotic focused format, and this allows them to manifest into circumstances and situations that create your experience. It literally filters your thoughts, feelings and desires and causes them to coalesce into manifested experience. It is a process, not an entity. It is a process over which you have complete control, if you can take charge of thoughts, feelings and desires and actively direct them toward what you want to experience. These thoughts must be relatively depictive. For example if you simply focus on change you create until you decide upon some precise idea of what you want in your experience. The process of how this works involves a Universal Law called Attraction. Once an idea is formed with the positive understanding that it is possible, then the ego holds this picture and completes the process through positive/negative polarity energy.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Through the action of the Law of Attraction and malleable nature of the potential of an idea actually coming into your experience, it does. Since instant manifestation of ideas on this planet at the moment is very difficult, the ego incorporates the process within your supporting idea of time. If you are unable to remain focused on your desire of a certain experience, then often times you deny yourself that desired experience. There is a comment in your Bible regarding “praying amiss.” Since that which you refer to as God is creative in nature, whenever you are focusing your desire in a sincere manner for an experience, then you are in “constant prayer” for you are within this creative, expansive expression that originates within the Source of your existence. But, what if your asking for something that would cause problems for someone else? The law works! But, there is an effect for that which you have caused. As noted above you are using the Universal Law of Attraction and its process involves like energy attracting more like energy. If you cause a problem for someone else as a purposeful use of this Law, then what you create for someone else, you also will experience. It is like two sides of the same coin. One is presented to the other person and one is presented to you. If you are serious in attempting to understand this Law, the if you dare, look at the events that you have already experienced and you will see that this has been the many times. When you have wished a blessing for someone else, you also experienced one, not in exactly the same way, but in something of meaning that came within your Life. Consider also difficulties. I believe there is a reference in the Bible that instructs you to “put a guard on your mouth for the words (including thoughts) that came forth do not return to you empty”.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In utilizing this understanding, you must hold the desire steadily within your consciousness. If you error in desire by wishing to create a problem in the life of another you have time early in the process in which to reconsider and to withdraw the focus of that intent. Then it will not manifest for them to experience. Emotion, strong feelings, can increase the potential of manifestation and hurry the process, whether it is for your own “good” experience or for another one. The opposite is also true.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is time for the entertainment portion of this purposefully written portion of the play and the distraction of your attention from your purpose for being within this experience on planet Earth to end. Now you must decide whether to take back your power, remove the blindfold of your own volition or wait until it’s removed for you. The picture will be even more shocking if you wait, for you will be totally unprepared for the scene planned for you to view. There is little time remaining for you to make your decision. The glitzy world you are living within is an illusion. Behind its facade is another one that plays out a game of power that requires your total cooperation and the giving over of your creative power willingly by overwhelming your sense of possessing any personal power what ever. Example: “But, what can one person do?” Sound familiar. Answer: “More than you can possibly imagine, but first you must realize that you have the power!”</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">Your Armageddon will arrive, but it shall not be in a format that you have been told to expect. The forces of Light and darkness shall not parry and thrust in a format of war, but nonetheless the situation will have moments of what might be called confrontation but it will not be in a 3rd dimensional battle of armaments. This should be comforting for the power of even those 3rd dimensional devices can destroy the planet.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If indeed the Creator is a focus of Love, then methods of destruction would not be possible. These are only possible within the distorted use of negative polarity energy. Within the two foci of positive/negative energy lies the center point of harmony. This is the goal of all manifested energy, to exist within this harmonious point. However, it has one disadvantage in that the still point existence would allow for no movement at all, thus it can be maintained for only a relatively short period. As a result there is constant movement away from and returning to this ideal. Within the totality of the Galaxy, there is a balance between portions of it moving away and toward this still point. This is seen in the movement of planets and what you perceive as the Mazaroth or Zodiac as they move in cycles around the center point of the Galaxy. Within these resolving movements are many smaller cycles that you cannot observe. When a distortion occurs within one of the smaller cycles it is allowed up to a certain point. When it reaches a point at which this distortion begins to affect larger cycles, then attention is focused to correct this distortion. This attention is not on planet Earth. Destruction would indeed affect other cycles. One planet in your solar system was destroyed. Balance was maintained with great difficulty, but the loss of another planet would cause chaos that would be far reaching indeed. For this reason a great deal of attention now being paid to your situation.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If it were not for the limiting factor of the freewill of the inhabitants, balance could have been obtained long before this point. This emphasizes the importance of obtaining consent through deception of the inhabitants for the introduction of atomic destruction devices. Plans are afoot to create the very chaos that planetary destruction would bring. The stakes are very high indeed in this game of control. The plan behind this destruction is ambitious beyond your imagination. It involves the creation of a negative polarity universe/galaxy. To the perpetrators of this situation, you are not even small fry in the game. This is confrontational at the level of the Creator of this Universe/Galaxy. Have we made this up? Indeed we wish we could tell you that, but it is usurping of your ability to make freewill decisions as to whether to cooperate or not that is the small key to the success of their plan. This will allow you to understand the multiple levels of control that have been used and why your complete control (which of course is impossible) has been used as the manipulation behind your deception. Indeed, there are many levels of control of the people on your planet. Those who think they are in control and planning this scenario are just as controlled as their plan for you. As this plays out, there are elements of this situation that are going to be more surprised than your general populous. However, perhaps that surprise will be at a higher level than even that plan includes.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What must be remembered in the greater perception of this is that all that exists and that does mean ALL, does so out of the potentiality that under lays manifested Creation. In following the layers of energy that coagulate into manifested realities in reverse order, the building blocks become finer and finer in vibrational quality until it reaches beyond what the cabala calls Ain Soph or pure potentiality. In order to cause an entire Galaxy to change polarities it would be necessary to return to this point to cause such an event to happen. Needless to say, this is an extremely simplistic explanation, but should give you an understanding of the audacity of the idea and the relative changes for its success. However, the attempt to this by working backwards through existing Creation to accomplish this goal holds within it he possibility of a pattern of resulting chaos of no small proportion.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Ow to come upon the realization that your conscious consent had to be obtained in order to accomplish this should give you cause to take notice of your responsibility in all of this. Unless you wake up and change the path down which you are moving, there is a great responsibility to be faced. Granted you have been lulled into a zombie like existence, but that has been your choice through lack of personal responsibility toward yourselves and your fellow man. At the end of this sojourn into Life experience, you stand and recount your experience in the light of full understanding and it is you who judge your won actions. No one judges you. You are then aware of what might have been had you lived our experience through extending the Love that created you rather than in pursuit of distractions that gave you no real satisfaction. What now do you do at this pivotal point in your time? In the knowledge of this picture, which you are hardly able to acknowledge may even be a possibility, what can you do? First you must contemplate upon this understanding and come to face it within your own conscious thinking process. You must consider it as possibly being true. Then you must admit to your unknowing complicity in the treatment of your fellow human beings on this planet. You must move through your regrets for having been unaware through a process of denial, for the existence of these situations was plainly presented to you by the magician. This use of your consent was by real conspirators with very large agendas to put into place. You cannot linger in the destructive guilt process. You must resolve to come into your personal responsibility to cause this situation to change from its intended path. You are expected to stop being a victim and certainly not to become a martyr for there is no place to begin to resist this onslaught. You must vow and commit to become part of the solution. Then, despite the continued push of deceptive encroachment into your awareness, you must begin to discern what is truth. You must hold to your resolve to move through this to a new and greater understanding. When this becomes your greatest personal Truth, then you will find opportunities to become part of a different movement employing methods that will not constitute physical resistance, but will use an entirely new approach. There is no other way open for resistance on a physical level would be immediately snuffed out. Your constitution is no longer an effective shield and will be dissolved. But, that matters not. It is in assuming personal responsibility that when one accepts the challenge and does not fade in fear, others also shall come forth in like awareness and consciousness. Together this spreading group awareness shall provide the pivotal point that will bring an end to this situation. The resolve to be part of the solution from the depth of personal consciousness is the key that will open the lock, end the imprisonment of humanity and bring true freedom to the inhabitants of this planet. Many are called, but few choose to respond. Where do you stand at this pivotal point? You must ask yourself and you must answer yourself!</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The question of “who?” Is the focusing energy of the “messages” is a difficult question to answer tactfully and yet completely. “Isness” is the focus to be sought by each individual awareness. As each expands within the process of self-identification so does the ability to allow the flow of “Isness” to move through their experience. Each will attract into their awareness knowledge to live into wisdom. The vibratory rate of the planetary environment and of the members of humanity on earth is low enough that this ability is currently visually inaccessible. To assist willing members of mankind to access the necessary information to provide a way to transcend this current aberrant state, various volunteer awareness points within higher vibrational frequencies have acted as booster stations to focus this information through those willing to participate on the earth plane. Knowing the custom of earth’s inhabitants requiring the “personify to identify” mode, names from exotic to the ridiculous have been given as sources of this information. The information included exercises in discernment, most participants failed the discernment tests. Must was filled with profound truth, but much of it was drained of energy by the continual parade of victims wanting their personal problems solved for them. The information become distorted as the foci were withdrawn and the volunteers winged it (faked it) on their own for their sincerity was lost in the notoriety and greed that resulted.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In view of this history, it was the mutual agreement between the parties involved in the dictation/translation/transcription process for these messages that the identities of the foci involved would remain unidentified and there would be no monetary rewards whatsoever involved. Further, there would no personal information disseminated for any one individual’s benefit. The totality of the foci involved is for the benefit of the planet and its inhabitants, period! The truth of the messages is to be discerned and used for the benefit of humanity first and then gleaned by the invidious to apply personally as part of the wholeness to which it is focused without the necessity of personal names to identify truth. If that is not understood, then the messages need be read again to transcend this need into commitment to the holographic intention of the information they contain.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is hoped that the succinctness of this message is accepted in the tone of importance in which it is intended. The window opportunity to accomplish the necessary monumental consciousness transition is small compared to the obstacles within the human belief system that must be literally dissolved so that the whole may be transformed. It is sincerely hoped that the truth contained will be a sword that cuts through the armor of deception and lays open the hearts and minds of necessary quotient for success.</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">It is imperative to begin with the most basic steps. Consider what are the most basic needs of man in the particular climatic region that you live in? Where you are with winter coming on it would be food, warm shelter and water? If warmth would be critical, it should be addressed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Let us take a hypothetical example of an earth change “disaster”. Suppose there was an especially severe winter storm in your area. This would be a storm that involved high winds, extreme cold and quantities of blowing and drifting snow. The electrical power would of course be cut off. Even if as was available, it would be unavailable to you unless there was a gas powered fireplace. Without electricity, you could not cook on your electric stove. There would be no electric lights. The streets would be impassable and probably telephone lines would be out, so you could contact no one.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What would be your plan? Have you even thought one possibility through to this extent? I suggest that you have at least basic emergency supplies available at home or perhaps in your auto as your are seldom anywhere without it being close by. A camp stove with fuel, some canned or dehydrated food, sleeping bag and most important of all - <i>water!</i> Be sure all is in working order, test them to be sure you know how to use them, see that all parts are there. Know what it is that you would do.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Watch you weather forecasts and be aware that any potential storm can be strengthened and steered. Instruments are in place and in use with the sophistication to do this. (HAARP) Inasmuch as we cannot interfere, we cannot protect you from this possibility. Of course this discussion has centered on only one of many possibilities. You may expect these to be happening around the planet as the equipment is tested in order to understand its capabilities before coming up with a planned sequence of scenarios to help them achieve their goals. Check your food supplies. Long keeping winter vegetables are a wise investment and do cook them to learn how, for most of you have fallen into the prepared food trap. Available lake or river water could be frozen and is seldom pure enough to drink. Water storage is wise and even that will not stay pure without special care. A camping purifier pump is available with extra filters. Consider adding a first aid kit, change of clothing, etc. I strongly suggest that you take stock, make a plan and actually put together a workable short term emergency kit and hit it in place. Once that is completed then add long term necessities on a regular basis. Once this is accomplished, you can then turn you attention to the business at hand. There was an old typing class exercise. “Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of your country” It would seem to me that is most appropriate now. But in coming to the aid of the country, one must put him/herself in a position of confidence so that in a crisis attention can be turned outward to those in need rather than scrambling to meet ones own personal needs.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In closing our first session, I would remind you that the days of greater chaos are drawing closer in an ascending quickness. Let us continue these sessions so that our clarity may increase and our messages may become truly a guiding light in the darkening of the days ahead. Sometimes it is necessary for darkness to descend before people can become of a light that has been shining all along. Thus shall the coming together of the true family of Light Bearers serve to vanquish the deeds of those with dark intentions. Always remember things work together to bring forth that which was planned long ago, for God’s plans cannot be thwarted. The duration and complexity of events can be altered if there is a faltering of faith and action on the part of those that have been placed in stations of service. None are placed who do not have the ability to accomplish their missions. Some will falter and perhaps even fail. That, of course, is a possibility, but back-ups are in place and things will move forward in Divine Order. If you trust the knowledge that there is indeed an overall plan, a larger picture, and that it will succeed. Then your own courage and faith will be less likely to falter. TRUST THE PLAN AND PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE DA TO DAY DETAILS. THIS KNOWINGNESS WIL BE YOUR ROCK WHICH TO LEAN. YOUR TOUCHSTONE OF FAITH.</p>',

In order for Light to trump over darkness there must be a vision of the Light that translates into a recognizable reality. Let us use the birth of the United States as an example. Though we cannot cover the details, we can look at the process, as it is known. There were those who cam together to envision something that was different than what was currently being experienced by the planetary inhabitants. No one person brought forth the vision, it was a composite of the inspirations that were but pieces of the whole.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This process must be repeated again. There are those who believe that you should return to what you have had before. Let us say that even that would not resolve the issue at hand. The “founding fathers” did not have instant communication, the Internet, exotic surveillance methods, under and above the sea devices as well as horrendous weapons of destruction with which to deal. You have allowed these to be created and though you long to return to a simpler time, you will either tame these or they will destroy you. You must look past the need to merely survive the methods of trickery designed to annihilate you and dream what you would have instead of the chaos of darkness. It is as simple as that, for as long as you choose to merely withstand and only survive the onslaughts of the oppressors, you are sinking deeper into the morass. You will only rise to the top with a new vision. We cannot give you that vision. The book of Spiritual Laws provides some guidelines, however the vision must be simple to be powerful. It must be visual in its simplify so that the people now surrounded in darkness can literally be struck with its beauty and feel called to its simplicity and clarity. How do you do this? A small group cannot do it alone. A nucleus must come together and as they begin the process others of vision will be drawn to it, in fact literally sent. The time for beginning this project is not at a convenient time later, but now. There is not time to be wasted if you are to accomplish this. To tarry will only make it more difficult and bring more suffering to the already oppressed. The window will close in literally weeks if it is not begun. I know you are caught up in the process of illuminating the details of the chaos, but what has that done to stop it? Can you actually see anything happening to change the speed of the decline? Then you must change your perspective. Look in the opposite direction. Are you part of the problem by observing it or can you become of the solution by looking for the building blocks of what you want instead?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Begin in your meditations to ask who would serve well in this project. This is not an esoteric process for people who are looking to give lip service and stand on the sidelines and observe. This is for visionary realists that may never actually observe the extent of the the work they do now until the very end. These people will be able to look beyond the chaos and recognize the opportunity. I suppose you might say these are people with one foot in each world, who can look into both without losing their balance. Once you start looking for them you will find them coming into your experience in what may seem to unusual to be accidental. Meet in 3s, 7s and 12s. This is the most important step to be taken now. Know that all help possible will be given on request. Many ideas will float through, but those of value will take root and the dream will become real, but first it must be conceived before it can be born. You need not feel total responsibility for any phase, only for the initial promotion of the idea.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The hour is desperate and the plans of God hinge upon the people of service. The awareness of the need for change is well established in the consciousness of many, now the vision must be planted, that it may sprout and come to fruition. May your day be blessed with the Love that is yours, for you are Love in manifestation. It is your job and your privilege to focus it that God may stand forth in Freedom and Truth in the experience of his beloved children.</p>',

By the Law of Attraction, a Universal Law, this is entirely possible. Of course the nature of the babe is determined by the birthing combination. It is the characteristics of these that shall have a profound effect upon the end product. Do not worry. Ones that should not be included won’t be, but there are many that are appropriate. Just relax and allow the process to flow, which doesn’t mean that this phase is yet complete. Indeed it is just beginning. Just setting minds to considering such a possibility will not bring commitment. You are most important in the birthing. It is receptive hearts that are willing to begin the processes that are important. The character, openness to act beyond the confines of the present moment, the ability to make and keep commitments, the love of fellow man beyond themselves, the desire to rise above the trees to see the forest that are the critical components for these parents. Through this process the awakening of man into again the “family of man” is possible. The ability of man to transcend the present self made dilemma into a new concept of experience will bring about a change not only individually, but to all and a ripple effect will be felt throughout the Universe/Cosmos. I know that this seems like a big assignment to begin from just 2, but each new child is also a miracle. Its beginning is hardly auspicious. Just a mass of dividing cells with no apparent organization into a miniature babe. But, at a miraculous moment, the appliance in miniature is there. Inspiration shall begin the change within the focused group consciousness.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The project assignment is that each new cell continues to divide. How exactly is this going to work? The first meets with two. Then each meets again with two others, then each again meets again with two others until there are 7. (3 plus 2 equals 5 plus 2 equals 7.) 7. Now the originals at that point can again begin a new cycle or drop out. The more times each individual repeats the process, the more the growth cycle accelerates. Can you see how the original organization can grow quickly without bringing great danger to the project or to individuals? At this point it is only the dream that is being promulgated. Then the babe takes shape at the critical point of greater group awareness, then the plan changes and the organs, so to speak begin to take shape for the different functions necessary for the creation of the dream. Since the focus is on the creation of a new experience, armaments are not a part of the picture and less danger is present. The focus is not resistance because forward movement into change is not factored into the detection process as presently set up by the oppressors.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">I shall leave you to consider what you have been told this far.</p>',

In this way the darkness wraps its insidious plans of subjugation and annihilation around your fellow earth beings.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Now begins in earnest the movement of the Light to bring an end to this situation. As with all things it begins with the process of thought and desire to bring an end to it. In this case, the subtle, modest beginning will go unnoticed. The opposing forces are planting their seeds of perceived invincibility everywhere. If this were real, they would not need to so at the level of a psychological campaign. Remember that humanity now numbers in the billions. That is an overwhelming number in itself. These are souls that are volunteering to be here for the benefit of this planet and these being have incarnated here for the purposes of expiring the next rising or at least to assure its success. They shall not go unrewarded.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Remember that this is a play. It is difficult to get this understanding across, but in a play, all you have to do is to change the lines to change the scope of the play. Well, you are a fragment of the whole of Creation and can begin changing the lines of the play. Is this an over simplification of this situation? It would appear so from your prospective, but indeed it is as simple as that. This project involves the formation of the group entity that can the change the lines or add a new character, however you want to visualize the process. Remember a visualization involves pictures. The words that you use in your contacts with those who might become the critical parents of this entity will respond to that which stirs their imagination and their emotions. Learn from your successful political elections, which appeal to emotion before logic. What works for this instrument of the opposition with the people can work for you also. The logical approach brings lots of rhetoric, but it is that which brings visualization and emotion that incites action. What is wanted here is action, not reaction. The resort to the use of arms against the plan for overwhelming making is doomed from the start. Yet the keeping other guns by the citizen of this country, means that their freedom is not yet gone. When those are taken, then you will see a real overwhelming realization among your people of the gravity of what surrounds them. Thus the timing is again stressed. We do not mean to belabor this, but there are windows of opportunity that must be used for our advantage for these offer the greater chance of success with the least amount of suffering for the greatest number.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Insofar as grieving in regard to those that are suffering, let me assure you that the number of souls incarnating on this planet increases the difficulty of <i>their</i> plans. (Note that I avoid using certain names, and you would be wise to that also after all within your circle the identity of these forces can be assumed as known.) Their role is well known to them before they incarnate. They don’t remember it now of course, but they come to assure the success of the process of our mission. Does that assure you of the importance of the earth in the total scheme of the grand picture? I would think so.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In the initial meetings of the small groups, no one visualization is likely to appeal to all, so one suggestion shall be given as guidance. “Ask and it shall be given.” A composite will emerge that will provide the appeal when participation reaches a critical stage. This diversity will aid in the masking process. You are well connected, so do not be concerned about this aspect. Use the visualization of dominos standing on end and arranged is a pattern when one is made to fall, all follow in rapid progress. It has great application to our meaning and brings an identifying tie to their planned process.</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">The willingness to be responsible for personal conduct and to change the focus of perception is buried within the busy (frantic) schedules of daily existence. Individuals find solace in their excuses for not confronting the growing signs of coming oppression. Breaking down this line of resistance and drawing as many of these into the new planned pattern of Life remains the goal. Those of the dark plan have set their focus to overwhelm any human beings with plans to resist and have preconceived plans ready to move toward the crushing of resistance. However there are none for the coming of a new vision. This leaves that opening available to us, in fact, the ideal opening. Our plan is not to fix the old, but to create the new. (There will always be the repetition of certain ingrained habitual thoughts, hopefully not to the point of nausea.) The skill of speaking, indeed even thinking, discretely on the subject of those with plans contrary to the will of Creation will aid in helping to bring that style of referring to them into usage. The more variety in this application of presenting the subject being discussed the better. It is easy for focused individuals to “get right to the point” but this will not serve in the long run.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It might be appropriate to point out that a linear progression within the scope of this project will not always be apparent. Divine Order is the “order to the day.” And Divine Order does not follow man’s ideas of sequence at all. You have set up certain unspoken, subconscious rules to give “sequential order” to your experience. The forces of God do not have to follow sequence to have organization. Therefore, it is important that once the process is initiated to a critical point, then you must trust in its completion of itself without the ego control so familiar to each of you. This is imperative, lest you monkey wrench your own dream.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Our co-operative effort and it is that, must begin, continue and end with focus on a completed goal. It is the composite of dreams of what a Utopian world would be like, one that each would truly like to experience that will bring this to pass. This is the opposite of the resistance that is expected. How much time do each of you spend in this “daydreaming” process? Survival daydreams are more the norm in the group that we are depending upon for this formative process. Granted such a thing, as easy earth compatible energy sources are a part of that dream, for luxuries of easy living are not appealing sacrifices for freedom from oppression. This is what is automatically supposed will be the cost of such change. Would a new paradigm of experience be without comforts? Different comforts probably, but I doubt anyone will feel any regrets for having given up the present situation. This again is the “resist or be shoved backwards” thought process that must be abandoned. That you want what will make your experience even better is a given, and it should be assumed. It must also be assumed there may be a short period necessary to endure in order for this change to happen, but it can be shorter than you might imagine. When this pivotal project is accomplished, our help is not only allowed, it is mandated. It is the beginning “think tank” discussions that will bring about the beginning of the change of expectation to an ever-expanding group. Think of a stone tossed into a pond. The ripples reach out to effect a greater and greater area. We call it a critical point, you refer to it as the “100th monkey theory.” Think of the counter thought group as having to send the ripples from the outside to the middle. Remember they are creating what is not in accordance with the laws of God. Their concentration is toward containment while your focus is toward ripping outward. Now, which one do you think works the best? When these ripples meet what happens? If you are using the same pond water, which one is likely to overwhelm the other, especially if the stone that is dropped is becoming larger and larger in what might be interpreted to be slow motion?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Remember there are vibrational effects that are and will be brought in to being that cannot be observed by you Each time the thought pattern is focused toward the goal, the more it becomes intensified. As it intensifies, it becomes more magnetic and attraction begins to build. You are not likely to surprise any of the contacts. What you are most likely to hear is that it has been in their thoughts already, but they just hadn’t made the effort to follow through with its implications. The process will become appealing and challenging when you begin to dream of ways to use the mechanisms put in place for the use of the hose of opposite intentions. Doesn’t that sound intriguing? Rather than to destroy and resist, it might be possible to use some of what they have in place for your own intentions. You have focusing powers that are capable of many things when there is group participation and a few innovations of your own can be added. Remember the pipe that sends vibrations to the crops in the fields? Even wonder what else it is capable of doing? You might be surprised. Even the sound embedded in Dan Carlson’s music for the growth of plants might be interesting in the presence of their focused vibrations. (Sonic Bloom). Just a thought or two about what you already have available.</p>',

That the cloak of darkness appears to you to be getting more intense can have its positive aspects. The closing of the noose is not as unobserved by the masses as you might think. Intuitive feelings are becoming aroused. The critical mass of awareness is being aroused and the other side is well aware of this. Remember there is a weak link within their plan. They are going to demand that their army of militia turn on their own people, indeed their own friends and family. That is a key point on which there will be reactions that they cannot predict. This allows openings in their plan. They seem minor to you in your consideration, but these can be used to great advantage for sometimes a moment is all the focus of Light may need. Ours will not be a plan of resistance. It will be the lifting up of a vision into manifestation through the minds of many. When the picture of what has been carefully planned for them is repulsive enough to their imaginations, don’t you think that they will turn with enthusiasm to a vision that thrills them? Remember there will be those who will choose otherwise. There will be a division. There will be enough that have been either won over or will be lost in the desire of continuing to experience the menu which has been fed to them in the media barrage direct at them. This will be a point you will have to deal with, as will all that join in this plan for transcending the decayed into the new birthing opportunity. All will not choose to join, and here you must recognize the free choice of experience given to each. It is not so much hardening your heart toward them as an attitude of allowance. Remember there is no death. Only the end of an experience and eternity is incomprehensible. It is not for any of you to judge what the experiences of each individual means to the completion within each Soul. The Soul draws to itself a composite and makes of these experiences patterns that dazzle the imagination. The dance of duality, darkness and Light as you will, are part of the play.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You must not become disheartened at any time, for there will be those who will surprise you. It is for you to keep your eye on the vision and to watch it unfold into creation from your limited perspective. That too will be fascinating. How will you know? It will be difficult in the birthing phase, for in the beginning  the process of a babe hardly looks like anything but a maze of diving cells, with no apparent organization. At the critical point, all that miraculously changes into a form. Then the challenge of preventing an abortion will become a dual focus. However, that too shall be handled. Remember this, as you begin to help yourselves, more and more co-operation from various forms of manifested Light can assist I ways you, and I, cannot imagine and may never be privy to know about. It is the focus on the vision that shall attract this assistance toward success.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We can continue to present this information to you, but there can also be discussion. Questions can be asked as long as they are pertinent to the process at this point. No diving allowed. Just focus on one stage at a time. As to what your continuing roles shall be as the plan unfolds will be revealed as each day arrives. There is no already existing vision except in a dim outline that is set up by the influence of the Universal Laws. At the time of filling in these outlines, those will be made known to the founding parents in very simplistic terms. KISS will be the “order of the day” for the entire project. How is that going to be possible within the contributions to the vision by many? Trust the process. The planet is experiencing on an entirely different level than it was when the founding fathers of the U.S. followed this same path. Note this time it is “founding parents,” and that in itself is a raising of the level of experience. Both energies shall be present and it shall make for a doubled energy focus. Though women knew the last time and supported as allowed, theirs was not a contributory role except as an outside influence. Neither shall dominate, for the vision must move beyond such selfishness and bring about a synergistic wholeness.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">At this point, you must not concern yourselves with the manifestation of their plan. You know of it, you are expecting it and so it must be ignored. Your focus must be on the moment and what is to be done. If that which you do now puts you in danger, herbs you should begin laying plans for doing something different. Not yet in this moment, but soon. Perhaps this surface activity cycle is drawing to a close. It is only a suggestion to be considered, though you have already have toyed with it. We leave it to your discretion. Corporate business. Will be allowed for actives that do not make big waves. Opportunities shall appear for your consideration. Travel shall be safe for a time yet. If you miss a plane or a flight is canceled take it within your stride. There may be many reasons apparent in retrospect as to why you were not to be on a particular mode of transportation. When travel is no longer safe, you will know. The focus of your intent now is to work within the activities of the parenting process.</p>',

(How is that for talking all the way around the subject?) It helps to bring it out of the realm of wishing into the realization that there is a way to counter their methods without adopting them. The work to be done is not at this 3rd dimensional level of resistance, but as I have emphasized before, at the casual level of creating what is another focus entirely. The reality of the possibility of this process has already been demonstrated in fields that indicate these processes can be adopted and focused in accordance with what is needed. The already proven success of these “theories” adds the inspiration needed to bring forth the birthing activity. It is recommended that the “messages” be held for those who would be encouraged to join the birthing process in the immediate future. These people will quickly see the correlation, and of course some are already in the awareness of some or all of its contents. A basic awareness of both sides of the forces present is needed and that information is available and it is necessary that it be known to those selected as the parents of this process. It is a human weakness to assume that what is known to one, is also known to all. Details are not necessary, but an overview would be most helpful with an available “catalog” of web documented information for those desiring a more comprehensive understanding in areas not familiar to them.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The processes mentioned in the “message” are of course known to those engaged in this broad research and these strive to be merely known, but not to create a situation that will bring public awareness. At that point their existence is a threat to the powers that assume invincibility. These would then be in a precarious situation as the noose tightens. Their importance cannot be stressed enough. This is the reality check needed to assure the success of the understanding that these higher vibrational realities need to be “pulled” into the experience of this planet. As the “message” reveals, the comfort zone under threat can bring violent reactions, not only in the circles of the opposition, but among the general public. The opposition at its highest levels knows that it is threatened by a possible collapse of their operation from the inside out. The mass consciousness is merely reacting in a “Pavlov’s dog” fashion. Possibility thinking is not acceptable.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Herein lies the need for careful movements within the project until the critical mass is reached. This is why the approach to the plan must be by word of mouth to known individuals who then take responsibility of approaching those who they know have the proper sympathetic awareness and desire to see the situation change. The ability to identify with the change to be made at levels behind the “5 senses” experience must be paramount in the beginning parenting process. It isn’t the number of people involved at this stage, but the quality of the awareness that is important. The ability to possibility think, the openness to expansion of awareness and the ability to assimilate and postulate into new synthesis, the known and unknown, is of critical importance. In other words, choose carefully. With that step clearly in mind, the proliferation will take care of itself. The clarity of the first combinations will set the stage for the entire process.</p>',

It is evident in the perceived world that surrounds you in both its positive and negative forms. Now the plan is to raise that process to a higher level, to engage known processes to further your exploration of the process manifestation. It is a matter of intention that brings forth the knowledge to be able to do this from a vantage point of awareness of the essential elements to ensure completion. This need not be done through blind faith in an unknown process. This would encourage an attrition rate that would ensure failure. It is a matter of making the data available to the conscious awareness and then allowing it to percolate. The inspiration for application will come forth into understanding. Manifestation is not a haphazard, lucky combination of synchronistic meetings. There are specific already existing procedures in place available to be used. It is a matter of bringing these purposefully into the awareness and then the creative imaginations will trigger the appropriate applications. “The luck of the draw” is simply too risky to be relied on in this project</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Here again the stress remains on the careful choices for the parenting operation. It is not desired to belabor this point, but it is awesomely important. Ours is a most important combination of massaging your consciousness (plural) and stimulating your concerns without bringing forth panic. We are finding this be a skill that is most rewarding. It is indeed bringing about the desired results. You are not the only ones to which this process is being applied. Just know that all that can be done from this level is being done. It is in the actual movement from the point of inertia that will allow this behind the scene help to aid in bringing forth the manifestation of the plan. Remember the birthing process begins with the dance of desires and culminates in an apparent miracle through process that go on for the most part beneath the level of conscious awareness. These processes are not haphazard, but proceed within exacting synthesis of multiple complicated interactions. If there was an original plan for this common place happening, then don’t you think that a plan for one as important as this one is also in place? If you do not need to be aware of the functions relating to the birth process of a child to complete itself, then do you need to know of all the processes that will happen in this project? The human birthing process would not happen if certain physical actions did not to take place to initiate its beginning.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What is being emphasized here is that you understand you will not shepherd the whole process to its conclusion. Neither do we want you to think you will be left out of the project once it is initiated. Indeed, you will be included in ways that are not in the most freewheeling of your imagination at this moment. In this case, we encourage you to trust the process and continue to be available, for you are all needed. You did not sign on for a short-term assignment.Let us continue now by moving on to other subjects that are of course related. It is important to keep a balance in this stretch of your understanding of this commitment to the transcendence of the planet and its inhabitants. Know that this is hardly a single handed commitment, but the agreed upon commitment of countless number of beings who are not strangers to the process. In this case, the energy of this particular planet has reached a level of heaviness that is challenging to say the least. But after all, you must know that all of you thrive on challenge and this is no exception. However, this time it is not a game, for failure would have serious implications beyond the mere suffering of incarnated beings. This of course is known to you a your deepest levels, so it is not meant as a threat. In this case, we are allowed greater discretion to assist and we are stretching it the utmost in order to initiate the beginning of this project. Much planning has gone into the methodology with contingencies covered for the art of improvisation is not limited to 3rd dimensional experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is known that certain lack of sincerity exists in the realms of those who present themselves as leading the resistance to the planned changes. In this case, either these will find themselves involved in other activities or you will have a distinct knowingness regarding the appropriateness of their inclusion. The identity of some of these might come as a surprise, but again you are connected to a point now that you will know in the moment when it is necessary to be cautious. Most of what is included today in this contact is known to you, it is as yet not possible to reveal detail for two reasons. The proper sequences are not yet in place and this line of communication is not yet at a level for these to come through. All possible is being done to prepare this last phase so that there will be a coordination of these elements. Again, we ask your patience and that you trust the process, redundant as it may seems at times. As you say, just hang in there.</p>',

The new focus must include elements of the higher dimensions. How to do this! Thought moves between dimensions as long as the thought is within those dimensional parameters. 3rd dimensional parameters allow for interfering with the development of others. It allow for the forcing of one will upon another. Above that dimension, all are allowed freedom to develop without this interference. Personal responsibility is the keynote of existence. Contrary to the mass consciousness appearance of the lack of development of this level, it is there simply smothered by the barrage of mind control techniques. However, those techniques are not as successful as it might appear. If it were, then the massive physical control that is being put in place would not be necessary. If it were, then there would be no problem of what to do in their view of over population. There would be masses of people following like lemmings into the sea. What is becoming a rising tide, is the ground swell of feeling of people longing for this personal freedom.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Through the moving of jobs from your country, people have found that they can create for themselves new opportunities, however nebulous they maybe within the “communications” dream of non-production. This success within planned failure has tweaked the creative urge within many thus the proliferation of home based businesses. It is this glimmering of personal success that has sparked a surge within even the most oppressed of the beings in your country, meaning the welfare recipients. This information has not stayed within the boundary of this country. It has always been alive in countries of great poverty. If it were not, more would have starved long ago.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This longing for freedom will be fanned into a blaze by the dream and its simplicity. It will be this new conception that will lift the spirits of those who will hear, and the lift will be literal. The inner prayer of the longing hearts shall be answered and their reaction to it will not be stopped. It can’t be reached by third dimensional methods, for those who try to apply them will simply be left as helpless as was the dark plan for the people. Once the critical point of awareness is reached, support of the new paradigm will take the planet forward as a whole. The “ascension” of the new age dreamers is one of individual flights into the clouds, but this shall be a planetary change. Your bible mentions two standing in a field and only one is taken. The person who wholeheartedly believes in the dream shall accompany the dream.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The parents of this dream must have the understanding, that 3rd dimensional parameters must be transcended and thought must be focused into the higher expectations of a new dimension. Trust in the personal responsibility of its citizens will be the key to the foundations of the new perception. It is the password, so to speak, for entry into this experience. Honesty and forthrightness are practiced without question. Your 23rd psalm translation misrepresented this by the word “righteousness” which was given the meaning of judgmental attitude, in particular, the actions of others. Instead, it was meant that each was to be responsible to live rightly within the personal focus on their life attitudes and actions. This would result in finding that games of inappropriate action will not work if no else will play by those rules. There can be no victims and no martyrs if no one will play that game. This may sound naive considering the chaos around you, but that is the difference. That is the leap that must be made, through the assumption that humanity has a critical mass that is ready to assume this shift in perception. The profit motive at the expense of all others has not lead to Utopia. Man in true prospective is a radiant being, meaning created to give outward the expression of the Creators Love, not to live as a usurper with only the intent of drawing all toward himself as depicted by the material experience. The experiment of this has left him hollow and unfulfilled. This shall be the opportunity to experience what will satisfy and fill his heart cup to running over.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">How can you paint this vision with the color of emotion that shall magnetize all that hear it and catch them up into movement toward it? Intent shall be the alchemical ingredient, and the Creators Love of his children shall spread butter upon the path, to convert an old adage to a different focus. It can be done, it shall be done, on that you place your life’s focus and trust. The etheric winds of change are in motion and the momentum is building. Do you think there is anything that can stand against the Creator of the game in the first place? It cannot be so. Welcome to the winning side! Now isn’t that a wonderful greeting?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This seems like a logical place on which to end this exchange of thought. Open your hearts and feel the love that is given to you for your trust and acceptance of our combined path in this marvelous adventure of adventures. How will we top this one? It is not for us to know, yet.</p>',

The realization of that will quickly demoralize the people. That was another sleeping pill of greater magnitude than you realize. Asking for shielding and for discernment was quite effective and it will be most helpful to use it as the situation progresses. It is something that will need to be done by each and not something that can be done for a group by one person. Again we go back to the law of individual responsibility. It will be interesting for you to know that the planetary consciousness is changing. Let us compare this to a breathing pattern.

That is an area of our discussions that has not been covered. The planet too shall participate in the plan to change the situation. Remember that all manifestation at all levels is the result of the projection of thought into the malleable ethers (your name for creative potential), and that thought is interactive within itself in the ability to maintain balance.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You can perceive that you are beginning to experience a focus of change in a co-operative energy vibration. This has the potential to synchronize the inhabitant consciousness to blend with that of the planet as a whole. Perhaps this will allow you to begin to understand why we belabor the point of the importance of the parenting cells being of the parenting cells being of the consciousness that will produce this blending vibratory ration. There shall be a quickening of the latent emotional connections of the planetary consciousness, not to the suffering on her part because of mankind’s infliction of selfishness and greed, but to the area of conscious desire for change to a new and different experience. Remember this is not the first civilization to experience here and you do not know the history of these previous scenarios. Just as you experience and learn, so also is this repeated in the evolution of the planet as a whole. Here you begin to see the damming up of energy that is occurring now. When a hole in this dam is released in a direction that the whole of this energy can blend into cohesively then there can be a release that will flush away the infection and bring about a healing of marvelous proportion. Just as a journey begins with the first step, so also this begins with the tiny hole in the dam by the formation of the first cells of the birthing process.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is not yet clear exactly what the planetary involvement will be as it depends upon the blend of energy that parents the part of the process that is contributed by humanity. It is the key that unlocks the whole of the project. We, of course, have observed various scenarios of possible energy combinations similar to your computer projections and find that each brings forth a vastly different combination of possible reactions. Each leads to a similar end conclusion, not only in different combinations of similar elements, actions and reactions entirely. Therefore definite conclusions cannot be made even from this prospective. Isn’t that interesting? We think so. Thus, once the selections are made and the first cells begin to act in the creation of. The possible “dream” scenarios it still will not be possible to project much of clarity until it, the dream scenario, becomes clear in the minds of these groups as a whole.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Can we guide this process based on our test projections? We wish we could, but that would be unacceptable interference. In this case, the guidance will have to come from a higher Source than we are. There is little doubt that the Highest of High is most interested in what is happening here and that Source will be available exactly the help needed. These miniature planetary think tanks will be allowed to play with possibilities, but the request for High Source help will no doubt have much powerful input into the completion of the process. I can assure you that this level knows mankind to its very core and will guide the process, but there must first be the movement beyond desire into active thought projection for the purpose of manifesting this new experience. After the creative dreaming of possibilities, then follows the purposeful focus process to place the skeletal outline in place. The great reward will be the painting in of the details with the experience of that which you will have created. The joy of this part of the process shall be wonderful indeed.</p>',

There is not a way out; there is only the way through. The subtle difference is not apparent, but is indeed of great importance. Out implies resistance, through implies movement toward a greater goal lying beyond. Just as one does not get out of a mountain pass, but must move through it, so must you identify with the subtle different application. Mankind falls into the dream of a great leader being raised up in consciousness to “lead” them out of this or any other dilemma. It cannot be. It must be by the inspiration of visualizing a way of Life that fills the empty void of their consciousness that the political, scientific and religious dogma of the past and present has brought to each. The realization that only by their desire to participate, following a personal conscious decision will lead them through this experience to what awaits beyond. Man is an adventurous being, loving challenge. This desire for personal adventure has been diverted into the false desire for safety, the assurance of limited risk (insurance). Remember the nay posters that appealed to the young men by offering the adventure of sailing to unknown ports, only to end up with wooden guns guarding a metal fenced enclosure such as did Bill Cosby? Military combat is represented as an “adventurous” activity, but it is not on a person responsibility level. Each activity is planned out not by the individual, but by the layers of officers. Yet military heroes are those that in the moment of need act on their own to accomplish a deed of great risk to themselves. For the public at large risk is left to such things as the risk of death on snowboards, skiing on possible avalanche areas, swimming in possible rip tide areas, climbing steep mountains, etc. These too shall soon be cut off, to further stifle the soul into greater limitation. The pent up feelings are then channeled into destructive outlets of wars, gangs, rape, pillage and other activities contrary to the purposes of manifested Life. This leads mankind from its original purpose of finding the connection and the path of return to the Creator.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You already know this, so of what point is this discussion? This is so that you might recognize the feelings that are prevalent, especially with the young people. What change is experienced when you remember that there is a plan to lead the human experience in the opposite direction, into the Promised Land of true personal adventure in dealing within the realms of personal self. This is what is being experienced in the greater manifested reality. It is but an enlarged mirror image of what is taking place within.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The identified 300 are but 300 focused tricks of these distorted egos given free rein through the manipulation of their minds. All effort has been made to assist individuals on the personal level to realize this. Now, the manifestation of the “evil” (misunderstanding and misuse) must be dealt with by the extreme method of bringing forth a movement to halt this process on the same level as has been achieved by the misused egos of the dark ones. This has occurred by the process of the ego empowering itself into areas contrary to its purpose. This process has reached proportions of imbalance, which endanger the integrity of the Galaxy/Universe. Extreme measures have been sanctioned by the Creator to bring this back into balance. Because of the Love of the Creator for his fragments, all possible means to return these into equilibrium is being made. Some shall indeed be denied manifested Life experience for what you would term long periods of time, as many opportunities to turn from their focus of separation have been given them. Others shall continue their lessons in other situations for they are but innocently duped during the experience they chose by incarnating here. Those who have true intent and purpose shall move through the experience by their choices of participation within bringing forth this manifestation of the new creation scenario. This group-focused demonstration will carry a power of transformation that shall be thrilling indeed. It is a gift of the Creator. This shall be a blessing and a gift of Grace through a profound Love focus beyond all previous experience. Through this shall the raising of this planet occur, its transcendence shall ripple outward through all of creation allowing new levels of experience. The transcending participations will enjoy the rewards of participating within this completion. The mercy and grace available within the Loving focus of the Creator is included within the infinity of “His” Love. The finite mind is unable to fathom this, but there shall be an expansion of the ability to encompass this to a greater degree within the focus of human experience and expression within the changing of the dimensions. But even the dimensions shall change through this scenario so that all consciousness shall be thrilled by the new experience and be further awakened.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Now, does the greeting “Welcome to the winning side” carry new meaning? Indeed! The intent of these messages is deepen the resolve and to give all possible support to the tasks upon your plates. May your hearts be inspired to continue your devoted participation with the blessings of all beings of Light involved in this project. Your bible has a saying, “and she pondered this in her heart.” An apt way of putting it. May you open your consciousness to experience the Love that surrounds, inspires and protects you on this day!

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">This, of course, is not without planning. It is for the purpose of creating chaos and confusion within the psyche. In actuality, this serves our purposes also. It is a great deal easier to create change from chaos than it is to bring it about within a stable, static environment. There are a great many planets that are highly developed within the adaption and adoption of the Universal Laws. If this is such a wonderful state, then the question is why focus the opportunity of transcendence of such magnitude as is being hinged upon this process through a planet this is in the gross experience of this one. The answer is that it is the chaotic energy that offers the greatest potential for this particular process. That which you call God has not “created” your dilemma, but it is His Creation and certainly he can participate in the potential that it offers, much to your benefit we might add. We are offering as many perspectives to this situation as possible, so that you might have as much understanding as possible. It is necessary that you rise above the stressful awareness. That much suffering is being experienced by many of your fellow human beings that have incarnated upon this planet now. This is so that you can perceive from a level of perception that will allow you to have a “God’s eye” view from which to conceive your plans. The conception of the “one world government” by the opposition also serves a purpose. Many of the incarnated beings have indeed put aside the nationalistic views they once had and are thinking in terms of global inclusiveness. The project plan will be one that will appeal to more than those of the USA. Of necessity it must be a plan of planetary scope. Necessarily, its beginning is focused here, but the total picture must be of global intent.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">There will be a particular intensity of chaos that will be the pivotal time for change, either for them or for us. Thus the timing for the creation and birthing into the awareness for his plan or dream as we have previously called it is critical. In the nebulous unformed stage of the process, the word dream seems more appropriate in that a plan indicates something already in though form. This is not yet the case and also keep it in the mind-set of a more playful and creative format. It does not carry the heavy responsibility emphasis for the participating groups. It is intended to promote as much possibility thinking in the broadest possible ways. In the beginning phases, there must be no thoughts of boundaries. Remember that we are not to consider the actions or the reactions of the other side. We are going to be dreaming within little known possibilities; therefore all things are possible. The continent plans of the other side can only work in their known reality. You are going to be setting up a reality that is far outside anything that they have even considered. It is this level of creativity that we are striving to encourage you to reach. This is creativity that will supersede and stretch beyond the current reality. Can you do this? Of course! Why do you think we tried out possible contingency plans? These are available for you in the etheric fields, not for the intention of you to choose one of them, but merely as beginning points for you to exercise your imaginations. Remember your imagination is the entry point to the “mind of God” which is infinite potentiality. The invocation of His Presence when “two or more are present,” is true to the degree you limited ones have not yet perceived.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Any preconceived ideas individuals members of these groups may have considered are to used only as beginning points. No applicable possibility has as yet been conceived. This may challenge some egos in early stages of participation, but this is a critical time in the education of egos. These observer parts of 3rd dimensional existence must be encouraged to enter into the imaging process and through this they will experience their true purpose. Even the ego will find joy within this process for in experiencing its true role it shall desire to experience more of this joy. Indeed, it is not an entity of separate identity, but is a very active aspect of the human experience that has received far too much emphasis within the complex union of Soul extension energies. Yet we must credit this distortion with the creation of this planetary opportunity, so from the perspective, this activity has contributed in its own unique way. God can turn anything into a purposeful synergy to benefit the whole. More faith on the part of mankind to the reality of this Truth would be of great assistance to them in this project.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The understanding of how individuals experience this incarnation fit into the cosmos scheme of things is a little like reading a corporate organization chart. However, this one would be amazingly complex for you to understand in totality for it does not follow the logical responsibility pattern of heavy at the top. Can you conceive of equality from top to bottom of something that has no top and no bottom? Stretches the logic of it, does it not? Does it make sense? Of course it does when linear sequence is not an essential parameter. How could a group accomplish anything without sequence being necessary? Quite well I assure you. How can things manifest without a beginning or an end? Amazingly, you think that it must begin as it appears in the formation of the baby. What appears to be process in 3rd dimension beings in the etheric. The unseen part of the process is a complete being and already exists at the moment of conception. From completeness in one dimension, it manifests in your reality. A flower was not brought into manifestation from a plan cell, but was conceived in its wholeness not only in appearance, but also in process.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Will your group be responsible for the conception of the process of what needs to be accomplished to change this earthly dilemma? Why do you think so many “etheric” beings are present? We are here to help you with the unseen processes needed. Once the skeletal outline is in place, in a form that will bring the desired results, then you will not be able to imagine the activity that will take place, all focused toward a “splendid moment of creation.” Are you being supported through this process? You had better believe it. But - it all hangs on the invitation by humanity of actively creating its own destiny through changing its perception of the ideal, in fact because of the chaos and confusion, in the creation of an <u>an ideal</u>. May the energy that awaits the initiation of the process in small part fill your experience. You are much appreciated and all possible support encompasses you this day. Be of good cheer as you go about your seemingly mundane tasks. Nothing in the lives of humans shall remain mundane for long.</p>',

Evolution is the term given to change in your language. There is a lack of understanding what the process is. What are they evolving toward? The enslavement of the remaining population is t he goal, but for what purpose? A stagnant Utopia? What makes them think that they Universe could or would support them in that process? To rebel against the process of creation is one possibility, but to maintain themselves outside of the focus of Creation would incorporate an ever-escalating process within its totality, and it is doomed to failure. To hijack a planet is one thing; to create an anti-universe is indeed grandiose for there would be no other way. From where would that kind of energy come? Do they plan to hijack an entire universe? I doubt that which you call God is so impotent as to allow that.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Again I say “welcome to the winning side!” This may seem impossible to believe in view of the above comments. From one perspective that kind of arrogance is humorous. Of course it is not for those experiencing the day to day flexing of the muscles of their power and viewing it from the basis of 3rd dimensional experience. To bring a transition in human consciousness, the largest view possible is necessary for those who would envision this change. Perhaps change is not the best term, for it implies merely adjusting that which already exists. This has been tried before in other opportunities to outwit the adversary. Obviously it didn’t work or you would not be facing this situation. This time you go a step farther in your refusal to play the game according to their rules. You must change your tactics completely so as to cause their plans to be as impotent as they have schemed to make you. You must transcend those plans. Much ado has been made for the “ascending” and for the “rapture.” Well, this indeed shall be our version of that, acc eat “Jesus” will not do it for you. You must do more than claim to be a “Christian.” It will not be necessary to get your hands dirty in the blood of your enemy. Neither shall you be required to turn the other cheek and look away as he does as he wills, for you shall have plans of your own that will employ God’s method that you have until now forgotten. The Armageddon of their vision shall never occur. There shall be an Armageddon, but it shall be played out on a different field and there shall be no conflict as has been envisioned for you. Your desire for delivery and your will to thwart these puffed up antagonists to Creation shall be guided to fruition along paths of remembering. This shall bring forth the elements of the spiral of evolution that are missing from their carefully laid plans. Fear not, for you have on your side the energies that create solar systems, galaxies, universes and cosmos, indeed All That Is. Could you ask for more support? It is not that it has been lacking during the previous opportunities, but that the cleverness and focus of the antagonists have planned carefully to bring this action to a planned point of implementation at the moment of coinciding cycles. This they believe to be a point of vulnerability. Indeed, however, at those points of cycle endings, the Creator has planned opportunity for His holographic fragments to take advantage of the spiral acceleration that is potentially present. Attention is energetically focused toward that process which allows for those who will to take advantage of the opportunity.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This has been a very simplistic explanation of this unique situation. Indeed history will be written in the annals of this planet. The pot boils, the steam builds and the Universe holds its breath as the moment approaches. Could the process fail? No, but the degree of advantage taken within the opportunity shall affect all within this Universe. Remember that the Creator focus uses all within the flow of ever moving energy in Creation. Chaos is especially pregnant with opportunity for change. It is not to put pressure on you that this knowledge is being shared, but to add to your understanding of the opportunity that is being brought into the situation that appears so hopeless. You must have your eyes open and use your ability to observe and analyze the actions that are taking place about you. The avatars of the past have planted the seeds of understanding that lie dormant within human awareness. It is time to stimulate these seeds into sprouting and growth toward a maturation of 3rd dimensional experience. Those that can accept this stimulation will and those that cannot shall be given other opportunities. Shall any fragments be destroyed? All fragments of the Creator’s awareness must be accounted for. Those aspects that have chosen experience extreme imbalance are put into a space that is something like exile. It is not a burning hell as used to frighten you into submission, but in a space of separation to consider and to contemplate. Beyond knowing that this experience exists, it is unnecessary to know more for it is between those and their own inner Spirit.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Will those that brought this to bear and those that choose not to share the opportunity be judged? Judgement has been a word used to conjure up failure and guilt. Release that concept. It is another of the tools used to control you, for instead at the closure of this experience there is a realigns process. A review and a time for the Soul (source of each human focused into experience) to assimilate these experiences into he matrix of its totality. The experiencing focus cannot measure the impact of its life experience upon the matrix of the totality of that which focused it. It is that which focuses contemplating itself. It would be self-condemnation for judgement to take place. Self-condemnation does not exist in higher dimensions. There is a world of difference between self-condemnation and Self-contemplation. Condemnation and judgement are synonyms.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This message is given in Love. It is for enlightenment within the experience of communion with the flow of Creation.

This indicates there have been others who have contemplated this possibility. The pieces of the puzzle have not been in their proper places before. In order for the chances of success to be at their greatest potential, certain sequential events and circumstances must be in pivotal positions. The mass consciousness of the planet has to reach a particular level of both the knowledge of the truth and a level of frustration within the feelings of resistance to recognizing the changes coming upon them. There is present within those with the advantage of media communication the awareness of the repressive process, but as yet they are in the denial stage. Even that is giving way to the suffocating feeling of the Inner Presence that is being psychically repressed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">You think of this as being a mind control game they are playing, but I tell you it is deeper than that. It is designed to imprison the Inner-Self, which then causes the brain to slow, and the mental sleep process appears as a symptom. If it were only a process of stupor at the mind level, then you could have all been drugged into sleep long ago. That is not the object of the process. What would that prove to the Creator? What is at stake is the proof of superiority through the capture and diversion of the Soul energy and the enslavement of those of particular energy matrix. At a certain point of the negative plan, those who have served them so faithfully will be among the first to be abandoned for they have already proved their corruptibility. Their ideal slave has a different matrix entirely.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If the plan is to continue the game into larger foci of power, then of what use are sleeping slaves? How then do the planners of this escapade locate the ones of value to them? Would it be the ones that do not fall under the spell of their concerted efforts? Just whom do you think that identifies? Indeed, the stakes are high for each of you personally. Does this description fit? Why else have you been allowed to continue in the business of pointing fingers at who they are and what they are doing? These comments are not to instill fear into you, but to give you the greatest possible understanding of the situation that is now in front of you, indeed upon your plates.

Herein lies a vulnerable point in their coordinated effort. It is like two pieces in a puzzle that almost, but not quite fit together Inasmuch as we look at situations in terms of holographic energy composites or matrix pictures, we are able to determine points of vulnerability. So, the point of this is that there is not a united effort within their reality of experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The second weakness in their methodology is that of feeding upon the negative energy that is created by the competition that is encouraged within their organization. When a weak link or defection is found or manufactures within the members of their groups, there is almost a feeding frenzy upon that departing energy. It is far more satisfying to them than the same even happening to one the uninvolved human beings. There is more of their own energy to feed the void of separation that must be maintained in order to continue on their path. They do “eat up” the competition of sporting events. It is the point of clandestine divergence of porpoise that is the major object of our attention. This opportunity is just that, our opportunity. Many scenarios to use this to our advantage have been considered. As yet no exact technique has been established, but several possibilities would accomplish the exact effect necessary. What we are saying here is that though your spearheading action is the key in the lock, there are forces at play here that are stacked up behind a dam that holds back energies that dwarf your ability to imagine them. Do not under estimate the importance of your role however, for it is the trigger that releases this energy build up. The forces of Creation are hardly impotent, however they must work within the Laws that create and maintain all of Creation, the magnitude of which only the Energies that allow the potential for creation can encompass. It is as if there is a holding of the breath until your freewill participation begins the shift in the flow of energies. We on the one hand must encourage and guide you in your desire to fulfill your purpose and assist you to be ready to act so that you can participate in the flow of events that will manifest as this flood of energies is released into movement. Thus we are something like your sports coach, always with our game plan, but having to adjust and figure ways of compensating for the fluctuations in your synchronistic interactions, the movements and intentions of the adversary forces and the freewill aspects of manifested experience. Unfortunately we don’t have any recognition for satined patience in this level of experience. Neither do we have hair to pull out when you surprise us with your personal decisions. The degree of commitment to the changing of the destiny of the planet from how it is now moving, is our only organization drawing power. The personal motive of the participating individuals is the primary element for inclusion in the beginning consideration of choice of contact. The other elements of character must be considered. “Blabber mouths” must of course be excluded, but they are not likely to be “available”. The last statement may seem a bit crude coming from our dimension of allowance, however it is necessary to make that point clear.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">There are many levels of information yet to be considered. Until the primary contacts and discussions are begun, it would be impossible to go further with a cohesive formation of directions for you. There are no planned shots in the dark so to speak. Even your contributions to the totality of this change in your reality must fit within the confines of the Laws of this Universe of of Creation. The Law of Attraction is at the foundation of all other Laws. You shall see this in the coming together of the essential beginning groups and in the final assembly that shall be the cornerstone of this new evolution of experience. Within this pregnant combination of consciousness shall this conception and movement into the birthing process be possible. It is often quoted that there are no accidents, however the freewill ingredient within the evolutionary process certainly contains the seeds of both endless diversity and the leavening of the mix.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We come to the end of this portion of our continuing dialog as this process proceeds in an accelerating mode. Your days are blessed with synchronicity and healing. Love and Light are showered upon you in great amounts in appreciation of your commitment.</p>',

We shall try to coordinate time/event correlation with regard to those events that are important for you to be aware of. At the moment, the contact between the parenting groups is the focus of the moment. As things progress, we shall give you such information as is appropriate. The methods of contact between the members must be in such a way that no clear pattern is apparent and the language used must be very vague. As we have mentioned before, certain words must not be used and certainly none consistency. Many of these people have their own pet names for those we often discuss. It would be well to avoid using these, but merely to allude to them or better yet not refer to them at all. This will help to prevent triggering the watch dog systems that monitor you on a regular basis. All systems of contact are monitored. You would do well to get accustomed to that understanding. The more recent that a method has come into use, the more easily it is monitored. Unfortunately wire and tomato soup cans just can’t fill the bill, so it is with thought and caution that you must use your communication devices. The dilemma of face to face meetings is that if you meet in a public place you will be noticed and if you begin to meet in a clandestine way, you will be noticed. This begins to sound like one of your spy movies, but things are as they are. At this point of course, there is no problem, but as there begins to be meetings among those of you who are apt members of this project, two and two will to make sense to them. The “ball” must be passed onward and outward with little return contact regarding the project in a repetitious fashion. No one person or group of persons is to shepherd the project.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">All future meetings for business or personal reasons must purposefully exclude any reference whatever to this project. Phone calls, etc., must not be for the purpose of comparing notes. At a certain time the appropriate group shall come together for one meeting in which the ideas for this future experience of mankind shall be blended together. A simple statement of purpose will arrive at identifying the new genre of experience as the focus of this project. This is the time that the choices of to whom the baton is passed must be carefully contemplated by each person and small group. Then each is to make their contact and the purpose explained in a face to face situation where it will be most difficult to be intercepted. Choosing within spur of the moment decisions of appropriate places is best. Your private offices are probably the worst. As I have pointed out before, you are considered entities with special talents and so are of special interest to them. Do not underestimate your stature in their eyes. We know of no other way to remind you of these parameters without setting the stage like a cloak and dagger movie, yet as this is but indeed as a play upon one small stage of Creation, perhaps that is not at all inappropriate. So-play your parts. well. Just remember that your timing might not be as perfect as it Bruce Willis’ in the movies.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This will come as perhaps a little late since the first of the meetings will have already happened, but that which is focused into this message has already been made known to each of the contacts through other levels of knowing within unconscious awareness. It shall be known to set this parameter. Other levels of your awareness are being instructed in this process as well as in this way.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We are pushing you, but once the process has begun, it shall move more quickly than you imagine for the pressure builds. The understanding of the hell that is planned for each and every human spirit shall cause the focus on a new paradigm to appeal to each contact at a spiritual level to a profound degree. A desire to participate and to help with the solution to the planetary dilemma will be like letting go of a long held breath within the spirit of each. An overwhelming gratefulness shall bring forth the action necessary, for it said, “God loves a grateful heart.” This is true and much can be accomplished through this emotion. It causes an uplifting of the spirit. Certainly those of you who have been in service through the spreading of the Truth of your fellow human beings can use an uplifting. As the acceptance of the future planned for this planet has come into understanding, the failure of the people to grasp this and their refusal to believe its existence, has caused you to face many a discouraging hour. But, you have each continued on with your spreading of the Truth. Isn’t this a glorious change of focus?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The understanding that at long last there is a way, a plan to take shape and forces of Creation are indeed here to give help. This shall be a pivotal point within each consciousness that will bring a change of attitude and will begin to draw in multitudes of awakening people. It is not that the message of the Truth of what is present and surrounding them will be different at this stage, but there will be a certain underlying attitude that will be the first trip of a trigger to each listening awareness. It will begin to be discussed and the message passes from one to another in a gathering momentum. No longer will it be limited to only those who listen to the talk shows and lectures. Those who have read and informed themselves shall be asked to inform and explain. Faithful tellers of the awful tale, you are the avatars of this time! But in the new paradigm victim/martyrdom has no place. It is not in the plan to allow that pattern to continue. This information is for your consideration. May your experience be filled with synchronicities and loving encounters.</p>',

It was not contemplated that the opposite would be created within the context of this focus. The joy of abundance was seen as a result of the proper placement of those laws at the center of the experience. Instead, the result was that the abundance of materiality became the focus and the concept of “the end justifies the means” became the framework of the distorted use of the Universal Laws.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If the distorted version of the Laws that indeed govern existence in this Universe of projected Thought is all that are known, then how do you create your way through this experience into a new paradigm which is in harmony with the totality of all that does exist in balance? This is the crux of the dilemma. If the earthly focus were created within a group focus, it would seem that a return to that beginning point would be the place to move toward. Picture as a beginning point, a small group of dots coming together into a single larger dot, then this dot expanding outward into a bubble with a focus point in the middle. All of this is within an expanding movement. Next see that bubble starting as starting to change shapes and become an elongated shape which continues to distort into various configurations until it is seems to be coming to a bursting point as more and more pressure is focused toward that point. Now, in your imagination, how would you return that configuration to a perfect circle? Think back to the way the circle was created in the first place and repeat the process. Isn’t that what we have been recommending? You need not be all knowing upper dimensional beings to do this, for as you come together with the intention of creating this return to balance, you need but invoke the creative process to receive guidance. Believe us when we say that it is through your <i>concerted</i> intention that this distortion will be brought into balance.</p><p class="lh-lg">It is the mass consciousness that controls the shape of the bubble. It exists within a flowing movement of the thoughts of all. As the negative pressure is purposefully pushing the mass consciousness to conform to its distorted thought forms, which are contrary to what supports the existence of the bubble, the mass consciousness begins to react. Certain available connections to the Source of each individual component of mass consciousness begin to enliven, to resonate as if being irritated by this pressure. The awareness of this reaction is causing more pressure to be applied through the methods that have brought the situation to the place that it is now. Think in terms of the bursting point on the bubble. If this bubble were to react, as would one of your balloons, this point would begin to thin and become more vulnerable. What if instead this point which consists of thought which thinks, would instead thicken and react in ways contrary to the apparent laws of the material world? Remember that thought thinking within itself couldn’t accept that that does not fit within the context of creation. Thought contrary to Creation is directional only by focus in what you might think of as requiring great effort. It cannot be released to complete the creation on its own. Thus this process requires that every contingency must be considered and contained within the plan or added to the plan which would then in turn affect the whole of the plan. Do you think this is possible when compared to the realm of thought that can think within itself and know every contingency in less than the blink of an eye? This all thinking thought has one incredible restriction called the “freewill” of the participants. However, when the freewill of the participants comes into resonance through intent and purpose, then indeed all “Creation” breaks loose, so to speak.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Is it as simple as that? What about all the Laws of Creation that have been broken by all those within the mass consciousness? Isn’t each of them required to repent and die up all their erroneous thinking? Come now, isn’t that what experiencing is all about? You have forgotten something. Each of you is thought manifested into 3rd dimensional energy! If thought can think within itself, then do you think that it can do that within each individual? It can, but has the one restriction of “freewill.” However, the desire to move through this experience and return this planet as a whole to its rightful place within the Creation is a “freewill” decision. When an internal boiling point is reached within each consciousness by the pressure being applied, don’t you think that there shall be a call within each for help from their Creator? There is a point when those who are under the spell of religions that require an intermediary to their God will bypass that belief and undertake a call within themselves that shall awaken the understanding of their true connection. When that reaches a critical level, then that shall join in the new point of focus being formed at the center of the real circle (bubble) of existence which within Creation has always existed. It is a matter of identifying with the real bubble and not the one that is the plant on the stage of the mass consciousness.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If that is the case, then why the big deal? Because the play is reality for the mass consciousness and in their freewill it is real and the continued existence of these Soul extensions is in danger of extreme damage with reaction that cannot be explained in 3rd dimensional terms. It is a matter of the realization by enough of these extensions that another reality is within their ability to identify and claim. Perhaps your greeting should be “Welcome to the winning side. Let us identify and claim!”</p>',

The magic of the beauty becomes blurred and the very home upon which you depend is shutting down around you and still, if noticed, it is ignored. The final days descend into the abyss while your TV, sports and potions of sleep drug you figuratively and literally.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What now can you few do to stem the tide of blackness as it deepens more and more quickly? Shall we recount again all that you already know and groan and beat upon your breasts, as did the photos of old and cry out for “God” to save us? Millions are already doing that as a Creator they think ignores their cries to answer their prayers. It is in the perception of victims that desire rescuing that they ask and cannot receive answers to such prayers. Indeed, only. Those prayers that ask for empowerment within the framework of Creation can be answered. Do you think that the stars stay up in your heavens by casual request of a god being? Indeed not! They are within the design of balance and mathematical laws that underpin All That Is. Man continues in his mindless begging and blocks the very help he desires by being unwilling to participate except in ways that are contrary to the very Laws that support his unhappy existence. The story of these Laws surrounds them in what remains of nature, but in his misery he blinds himself. The scientific learned ones analyze the components but no the process of Life within the manifested structures of Life that surround them. The mental analysis of the mind deludes him into arrogant belief of his superiority over his surroundings rather than his brotherhood and kinship within it. How can those be helped the are becoming more and more blind to the very process within which they exist?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The victim cannot be rescued, but must pull himself up by his own boot straps and rescue himself by being responsible for his own rescue. Man is made in the essence of his Source. He is a tiny holograph of this Source. A holograph is a tiny fragment of the whole that has the potentiality of projecting the whole from which it came. Though the concept of the holograph has been encompassed in part, it has not been “analyzed” with application to the essence of Life that is within all self-aware beings. It is the refocusing of this fragment toward its source of existence that determines the degree of the totality of the Source that is brought forth into the known reality of each fragment’s experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If you consider the degree of the focus that has brought forth the planet Earth from the fragment of it Source, you can begin to get the picture. Look at the magnificence of the human body that is the vehicle of your experience here. A vehicle capable of housing a self-awareness that can contemplate its Source if it but will, because that Source contemplates itself and in so doing fragments itself so that it can further contemplate Itself through manifestation of experience. Within it is the freewill to do this. Since freewill is the vehicle for this contemplation, then it is manifest within each holographic fragment. This freewill allows for all experience within a further enhancement of this Self-contemplation process. This is the polarity that enables the recognition of that which serves the contemplation process and that which does not, so that the balance of these allows the completion of each exploration into the return of the fragment originally projected to its Source. To follow this process as presetned, there is a spiral of understanding as this is contemplated by the mind reading this information. Each fragment returns itself to the Source that projected it. Thus you are lead to understand the framework of the process you are within, for each of you are a holographic fragment of the Source of all that is in the process of self-contemplation. Ah, panic, you will become as nothing if you follow the path of the return. Indeed not! With each returning phase toward the Source of your entry into experience, your own self-awareness grows and it becomes greater and greater until you have the absolute potential to being a total equal within the greater Totality of that Source contemplating Itself.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Does that boggle your finite minds? Indeed it should not. It should be the most comforting news that you have ever encompassed. Could there ever be a brighter picture of your future ever painted? What possible pleasures could ever compete with a future like that? Let me assure you that there are no fleeting pleasures of the body.incarnate that can compare with those that await you as the fragmentary self-awareness begins to ascend the spiral of experience toward the ultimate goal. The problem is bridging the gulf of misunderstanding that has been set as a trap by ones that have become caught up in the distorted misuse of the aspect of freewill. These pitiful ones have become so caught up as to perceive themselves as powerful enough to reach not only total equality with the Totality of the Source of All, but they they can reach a place of Superiority. Even the distorted psychiatric paradigm of your time would consider this insanity if they could but encompass the scheme in its totality. Within this distorted power grab, it is necessary to have a distorted replica of the process. A counter part to that which exists, Humanity is but one building block of this, for they cannot create from a negative potentiality. Try as they have, it will not work, so they are left with the process of converting what already exists from what you term positive into its opposite, a negative counterpart. Now, this is not a recent event in your linear counting process. How much have they accomplished? So as to not overwhelm you completely, let us say that it has reached a critical stage. To allow it to continue would jeopardize more of manifested experience by the Source than is comfortable. Enough to bring a focus of the awareness of this “awesome totality” of Source to bear upon the problem. The potentiality of this Focus for bringing balance back into the totality of the process as explained above is awesome to contemplate, even within the limits of 3rd dimensional perception</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We have attempted to explain before that there is help available, the it is powerful and have even understated it. However, the key key to the release of this awesome force lies within that which has created the situation in the first place. <u><i>FREEWILL!</i></u> If you were not of the exceptional value beyond being the vehicle of change, other means of ending this could employed. The fragment from which each and every individual fragment of that Focus is a portion must be accounted for in order for the balance of all to be maintained. You cannot be simply written off. That would create a flaw that would cause unacceptable repercussions. All fragments must return to the Source from which they were focused (projected) in order for that Source to remain in the balance of wholeness. That is not to say that those that have perpetrated this distorted experience to the extreme will not have some interesting educational experiences, for certainly they shall. Your perception of time does allow you to contemplate such a process, so do not attempt to do so.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It is important that you gather into your awareness the wholeness of this situation so that you can begin to contemplate the understanding that even those of darkest behavior patterns are valuable to the Source that you call God. They are a part of the totality of all that the word Source implies. Simply telling you that they are a part of “All That Is” has not brought with it compression that encompasses the necessary understanding and so another approach to it has been attempted here. A back to basics lesson in your vernacular. Let us hope that this has now been accomplished. If not, perhaps the re-reading of this will bring it about. It is not that we wish a softening of your attitude toward what is being perpetrated which would further their negative cause, but that you understand why simply destroying the whole experiment is not an option, or why just messing up their plans is not enough. The Source, the Big Boss, wants it resolved and who are we to argue? We have this <i>key issue</i> to resolve. So, let us get on with it.</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">Your fellow awake and aware co-inhabitants are certainly noticing what is going on here. This is different from the suffocating direct manipulative energies that are being diffused upon your conscious awareness. The galactic attention is coming through energies too subtle to be picked up by the mechanistic methods in use by those of focused dark intent. The opposition must attain its ends by employing methods of suppression of the natural expansive movement of thought within manifested form. What is flowing into your mass consciousness from the galaxy that surrounds you is of a natural expansive quality. It is received within the awareness and then follows its expansive nature and arrives exponentially outward into concuss awareness as dreams and sleep patterns that are not restful. The governing factor with regard to the receiving of this galactic message is the degree to which the inner awareness of each individual has been suppressed. How slow is the vibratory rate of the being? Can it still receive the stimulation of the higher and more rapid vibration of this galactic thought form? This is not a message of condolence that is being sent by sympathetic individuals. That is a trick of the lower dark energies, another of their suppression techniques. Rather, this is a focus of stimulation so that the receptors of Light which hold each in focus may be returned to greater use.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">So you begin to see that there are two foci of energy in motion one of suppression and one of stimulation. We prefer not to use terminology of war here, but it can be noted that the “battle” for this planet is already underway. Not as depicted with carnage everywhere being created by both sides, but in the claiming and the returning of Soul Energies. The one side is planning for many, the other for all. Remember if one tiny unit of energy is truly destroyed then the totality of all is lost. The Source of All That Is is expansion in nature. The energy can change form through what appears to be the rise and fall, the birth and death of form, but the energy that is at the very basis of this phenomenon is <i>always</i> present.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">A polarity always exists within the format of this ever-present energy, however it does not have t o be present in the format of another subject. What you must understand is that what appears to be the opposite polarity in the experience of planet Earth is an aberration, a distorted use of this polarity in energy. It is the exception, not the norm.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The more clearly that you understand what is available to you within the context of this situation, the more easily you will be able to maintain the focus on your purpose within energies that are in motion around and through you. It is easier to succumb to the energies of suppression in some moments of your time than to maintain your focus upon stimulating energies that are acting within you. The “battle” is not upon the surface of the planet as you have been told, but it is within the individual awareness and it is by definition also within the planetary awareness. It is either understood or misunderstood, that within the planetary awareness,  the minds of humanity in combination is the conscious awareness of the planet itself. Therefore  the transformation of the planet, earned by her through her repeated motherhood of evolving civilizations, hinges upon the transformation of her current resident civilization. You can begin to understand that the unity of this evolvement process brings forth the potential for misuse. The inner coagulation of energetic purpose is organized for the process of transcendence. The polar opposite conceived one world suppression rather than planetary expansive transformation into higher dimensional (vibratory) experience. With the presence of so much heavy energy though exchange between the planetary inhabitants, mind to mind exchange of conceptual understanding, has reached very low ebb. This has resulted in a proliferation of mechanized communication, each representing the abilities once in common use by you without a manifested device to make it possible. With the rapid advance of these technologies (devices) through the focus on heavy slow vibratory manifestation, what appears to be marvelous advancement is indeed quite the opposite. It represents a loss of ability to focus the formative, expansive use of the power of thought inherent within all Creation. Slight of mind is at work again diverting your attention from the potentiality of creating outward from within though the use of the outer mind activity of analysis and manipulation of your manifested reality. The natural flow would be toward the exploration of the inner awareness and manifesting outward into your realities the greater experiences to be found there. Where do you think the greater people serving ideas come? Instead these are being twisted into people suppressing uses right before your eyes while you fail to observe what is at work. All the while you are watching the showing staged, diverting your attention.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">So, now the fun begins in earnest. You are making your final attempts to reach the inner awareness of as many as possible through the last available use of their technologies, but you are also beginning to join forces with the inner energy stimulation. You to are receiving this stimulation. Indeed you are like the repeater stations that your radio stations use. You are serving multiple purposes and you are perfectly aware of doing this within the inner awareness portions of your totality of experience. Trust the process and hold the pole, so to speak. All is far from lost. Welcome to the winning side! Focus and manifest!</p>',

The cycles are repeated over and over. The people are abandoned by their governments and so must fend for themselves within situations of less and less available necessities and more and more regulations. Not a pretty picture to behold. So-what now?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Let us again consider possibilities that could bring change to this nightmarish situation. Could it be that the forces behind this situation could be creating causes to culminate this planned suppression of the people of. This planet that might involve repercussions that are beyond their ability to control? Could there be small unknown glitches in those plans, which if exploited, could cause outcomes not planned? It is indeed not only possible, but probable. Let us consider Y2K as just one possibility. If indeed all of the technological wonders of the basics of power, water, communications, money, travel, etc., all depend upon computers to operate, then so also must the military and conspiratorial communication systems and other wonderful mechanism of planned use. All of these were constructed by contract. It is well known that contractors deviate from specifications whenever and where ever it is possible to cut costs. It is entirely possible that at least some “off the shelf” computer chips have been used rather than the special designs that were specified. If those substitutions contain the same date problem as those purposefully in use for creating a chaotic breakdown of your world as you know it now, how will this effect their plans? Since there must be a synergistic exchange of information within computer systems there may well be repercussions within their own separately created system that will cause chaos within chaos. Portions of their plan may deploy, but in order to establish and then maintain complete control, which is their goal, all must proceed according to plan. What if enough of their plan moves into place for the people to realize the truth, but their own internal chaos allows for what we might call melt down from within? What if champions of mankind working within may have deliberately placed glitches within their systems? Interesting to contemplate.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Let us suppose that the above scenario is true. Now we have what we might be called double chaos and exposure enough of the enslavement plan to bring humanity awake. This adds a 3rd layer of chaos. Out of all this chaos, how does the balance tip toward survival of humanity and the planet? There is one more element that must be interjected here. What of those extra-terrestrials beings that have been using the power structure they have coached into place? Would the above mentioned chaos serve their purposes? Could they have sabotaged the plans of their own henchmen in order to eliminate them from the game? Do they have in place a plan that overlays the ones that are in place? We might say that the plot thickens.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">However, we could thicken it even more, since we delving into possibilities. When one planet interferes with another to the detriment of the progress of that planet, we have the Universal Law of Attraction at work. Simply stated what you do unto another shall be done unto you. If you interfere with another planet, then you have given permission for other planetary forces to interact with you. Ah-ha! Does the thick plot begin to come into clarity? Let us hope that your heart just skipped a beat, and real hope has been born within your imagination.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We are still left with the dilemma of all that chaos. So, let us give a bit more clarity. Once a planet has been interfered with in a direct way, other than an advisory capacity, the inhabitants of that planet may <i>request</i> help in restoring balance and other. Herein lies the key. Help must be requested and prayer is considered requesting. However, it must be what is called affirmative prayer.Affirmative prayer is entering into the creative mode that is your pattern (made in the likeness and similitude of your Creator). Humanity must actually come forth in a group focus, in a harmonious creative mode within the upward spiral of the development of individual and planetary evolvement. Now, knowing human nature, there will be those who, when they have recovered from the shock, will immediately want to put back into place what is within their comfort zone. They will desire to take advantage of the situation to create another situation of power over the people, for indeed the cry will be for new “leaders.” That would not be evolvement. The next level is based upon individual responsibility. Unless that is at the basis of the new paradigm the opportunity for the transcendence of this planet and its inhabitants will be lost.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The importance of an already perceived outline to be the “prayer of requesting help” needs to be in place to supersede any changes of returning to the old. The help you need to bring this into being will then be assured. This help will not be military in any way whatsoever. It will be the Love of the Creator manifested and shall be genuinely welcomed as it shall interact with the Inner Being that is the forgotten direct connection to the Creator. Love connecting and interacting with Love shall bring changes beyond your imagining abilities. It is also appropriate to note that on a planetary level, the planet itself shall have a like experience.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">May this information offset your concerns about your futures! Welcome to the winning side! Focus and manifest, indeed!</p>',

        'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">They were told that it was a futile attempt, but it was their choice to continue on in their chosen path Inasmuch as freewill is the loose cannon of the Universal plan for evolvement, there was nothing we could do. Now it has reached the point at which their plan is indeed a threat, not that it could ever fulfill their desired goal of a negative universe/galaxy. It can however create unimaginable chaos. Do not take this information lightly. It is indeed a serious situation. This is not the fault of the inhabitations of Earth, it is just that this was the planet with the consciousness and physical manifested body type to fit the most ideal criteria for their plan. This is not the first time they have tried to overwhelm your planet to use it and humans for this purpose. It was a long time ago in your sequential counting. They were far advanced then in their technological gadgetry, but did not understand humanity, which allowed them to be repulsed. Unfortunately humanity chose to use force to do so and in that way buried within their psyche the belief that force was the way to solve any encroachment upon their perceived freedom. In a way, it married you to them through this perception.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">This time, they believe that the earlier error in understanding their foe will not be repeated, for they have studied you well. Every weakness is known and is being exploited for their purposes. However, their focus was upon inducing your cooperation rather than resisting them until it is too late for you to do so. They carefully laid plans to overwhelm you both sensually and physically. In particular they have emphasized safety over adventurous risk except within military paradigms. So you have insurance for all risky portions of your regimented life. You have your addictive paycheck system to depend upon, along With Social Security. (Notice it is always capitalized right along with your references to God. Even omnipresent Satan Claus is capitalized.) Your heroes are all well paid sports or movie stars. How adventurous are these? Your movie star heroes are drugged and adulterous in open display along with your presidential movie star. Remember if you can be held at the lowest level of your dimension, you cannot take advance of the dimensional leap at the shift of the cycles, but can instead be taken to an even lower level of vibration. At that point it is their intention to separate the soul energy from the body. They have no intention of putting it back into another body. It is the energy that they plan to use as power in the transformation of the chaos they intend to cause from positive to negative. They believe that the lower the vibration, the nearer it is to the still point, thus making it more malleable. All of these theories have been concluded by attempting to study Creation through the process of following its steps backward from manifesto to creative impetus.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Fortunately, there are many miscalculations in their plan. But not enough to avoid creating great chaos indeed if their plans progress much farther. Here again we are faced with the great stumbling block of freewill, the key ingredient in both bringing this situation into existence and causing it to self-destruct. This magical key is held by consciousness of the being on this planet. The consideration of the situation from the above point of view allows for it to seem to be a very bleak future indeed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Enter the view from the other side, that of Creation. This view is adventurous, opportunistic and positive. It moves not upon long and exacting plans, but within a fluid and expansive mode. It moves within a creative stance that allows for enhancement of individual and collective experience rather than suppression and destruction. Remember the picture of the pond! The other side must control the ripples from the outside in, while WE may cause them great problems of containment by using just one small pebble, one idea continuing thought focused on creation. We have here two opposite modes of movement within the totality of Creation. Now, looking at the big picture, on which side would you place your bet? It is not that our side does not have problems to resolve, it is just that we have the innate natural expansive consciousness that harmonizes with the intended Life experience. Even though the conscious awareness appears to be mesmerized into sleep, how does one bring a hypnotized person back to consciousness? Is it not a snap of the fingers? But must that trigger be previously programmed? Not necessarily! Their planned trigger is the sudden mass realization of overwhelming control, an emotion they plan to feed upon with great enthusiasm. So, we have been busy triggering this realization in a slow and steady manner so as to not alert them to the damage that is being done to their planned trigger. Remember the 100th monkey theory? It is a slow and increasing dawning of understanding within the mass consciousness until a critical number reaches an awareness of a new concept and all know. Guess what! We are disarming their trigger Are you aware of the awakening happening now? You were hoping for sudden realization while we were implementing the opposite. We are planning surprises of our own. It is indeed rewarding or fun as you put it, to be on the winning side and know it. Now, is the time to begin preparing the step in the process of a new focus for the awakening awareness of your planetary inhabitations. A new paradigm of experience! How fast must it move into the fray? Don’t sweat that for a minute. Just do your part and all will come into play right on time. Once the first crack in the plan is complete, things will pick up in momentum. Just remember that we are hardly impotent. It is just that we must play the game according to the rules that insure success. Not so for our opponents! Keep in mind that the Creator must retain all of his fragments; even those that are perceived opponents. He cannot stop caring for any part of the whole of His being.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">There has been little information with regard to your personal experiences and application in that area. This was not to indicate that this area is of little importance. New age information, better called new thought which could be categorized even more accurately as “remembered thought,” emphasizes the need to be balanced and chants “be in the now.” In actuality, that is correct! As previous pointed out, all of the cycles within the cosmos/galaxy move toward and away from the center point of stillness or perfect balance. In order for the galaxy to be in balance, the cycles are moving within a balance of those moving away and those returning to each balance point. You could picture it as gyroscopes spinning and moving around a central gyroscope that reminds in perfect balance and puts forth an energy pattern that holds all the smaller gyroscopes within its sphere of influence. Each gyroscope outside the central focus contains within it a myriad of smaller gyroscopes. In order for this entire system to continue in existence there must be an equality of energetic motion. If one gyroscope gets far enough out of balance to approach a point beyond its ability to return, then focus of holding it within the range of safety. This is, of course, an over simplified picture, but gives you some understanding. It allows you to picture Earth at its tilt of 23 degrees of approaching a point of losing its ability to return to balance.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If you consider that within the gyroscopic picture of Earth, there are 7+ billion tiny gyroscopes each spinning on their own axis, the balance of these influences the balance of the larger one. If most of these are out of balance, then of course the larger one cannot remain in balance. Grasping this picture leads you to the understanding that the 4th universal law is that of balance. One pattern of thought that holds powerful influence in the balance or imbalance of personal expression is that of past, present and future. Since all are necessary for various reasons of survival and progress, they are embedded within the ego observer mode. You remember the burn and so do not touch the stove again. You desire to build a large house for your family so you envision the steps your future must contain in order to attract that experience, and so you migrate between the two. However, there is the moment of now that you experience that is not either past or future. This is your balance point. It is your place of rest. You return there during each sleep cycle. There was a time your planet revolved in the cycle of light and darkness, all were active or resting in unison which brought greater balance to the whole. With the advent of artificial lighting, this balancing pattern is no longer present. Mankind now has constant activity first with the “industrial age” Now in the “technology age” even within the homes the hours of rest within a family are varied. A balancing technique Is practiced in what you call the Far East and is called meditation. The new age group quickly adopted it. Techniques are often distorted and the conscious awareness is overwhelmed with media clutter and unable to find the still point of balance within the combination of conscious and subconscious. Entering that still point allows for connection with the Soul and balance to be reached for at least a short time.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Balance is reached through the understanding and practice of the three basic laws of the universe: attraction, deliberate creation and allowance. If you review the previous messages, you will find within the information suggestions for resolving this problematic situation of the population of Earth. In order to live the new paradigm of experience those participating will be required to focus within present time. Only the framework will be known and it must be fleshed out through “living it into existence” experience by experience. This will require living within present moment reality. Within this focused group experience balance will be attained. The past cannot be applied and the future will be unknown. That will leave only the present. Let us consider the galactic cycle completion. Is it only a momentary instant that is available to accomplish a grand ascension or a ghastly dimensional crash? That depends. Again we return to your fixation of experiencing measured blocks of sequential events. Experience within what you call the present moment is a misnomer, an inapplicable designation. When you are focused into what your thinking or doing with no awareness of any other activity, you “lose track of time.” Each of you has experienced that. Only by looking at your time tracking device called a clock do you have any idea of what the time might be, other than the presence or absence of sunlight. If each of you were totally intrigued with what you were doing, that was your only required focus and there were no seasons to concern you, would you care what day it was? If that intriguing subject opened the door to another and another, would you care what day or time It was? I doubt it. If you were in balance, would sleep be necessary? What about food? What about recreational pursuits? Aren’t all of these necessities really just a search balance? This is not suggesting that you become breatharians. These are simply ideas to intrigue your imaginations. Your experiences are so far out of intended balance that it is difficult to imagine what balance during wakeful experience is like in 3rd dimensional format. It is far more pleasant than you know. No wonder you desire to leave this dimension thinking that respite is only to be found elsewhere. Without balancing of the 3rd dimensional experience you could not exist in higher dimensions in your body format and current self-awareness. First you must come into balance. Because you are all interconnected, individuals have insurmountable problems manning balance even if it is achieved. It is necessary to bring a large number into balance to accomplish what is necessary in the bigger picture.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The bible warns you not to place “pearls of wisdom” before those who have no viable connection to their source of life. It is time to strike that idea from the books. It is time to do another 180-degree turn and to do it in practical applicable terminology. The pattern has always been to hide it within religious and esoteric terminology so that only a few were privy to the information, lest it be lost through individual interpretations that might destroy it. Without written words, for few were literate, allegorical stories were the only method of dissemination even the basic understandings. These contained references to activities and other commonly known and understood references that were within that local cultural environment. Even these basic understandings became distorted when the stories were retold in cultural situations that had no reference points to those original understandings. We find ourselves of necessity reintroducing the basic. A good place to begin a new beginning, don’t you agree? Attraction, intention and allowance leading to balance through application within experience. A doctorate in those positively leads to ascension to higher dimensions. Welcome to the ascending team!</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">I thought Kirk Lazarus in tropic thunder was really a black guy. I didn’t know it was Robert Downey Jr. in black face, back when that was allowed. He [Robert Down Jr.] fooled me twice. He is a white actor playing an Australian character playing a black character. And I still thought for the longest of time, for years, that it was really a black guy. Now, if I can admit to that, can you admit and forgive yourself for some of things you thought you knew but didn’t? Because, to quote the great Lazarus: \'We\'re really fucking lost man!’.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In the middle of the movie, the unit of actors reach the dan cook river. “We’re lost man! We’re super fucking lost man!”, cries out Lazarus. They take the map away from their blissfully ignorant leader who have led them astray by miles and decide to turn around and go in the real direction towards their destination. I think we’ve reached the same point in the covid-19 planned pandemic. And we need to take the map from our government which has led us so far astray and get back to the destination which we were initially headed. A better society for humanity based on moral principles, rather than that of indebtedness and serfdom through a new world order and global banking system.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">When our government, realizes that too many people have woken up already, the tied is turning, and that they will be held accountable for the crimes the committed against humanity and frantically yells out in a desperate attempt to control us: ‘But we’re suppose to be a unit’. Remember the word of the year in 2021. ‘Samfundssind’. Showing community spirit. Well, once you wake up do like Kirk Lazarus and tell the government to: ‘Suck my unit’. In the utmost polite way possible. We’re still ladies and gentlemen of the court at their trial, remember.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">“You about to cross some fucking lines!”, replies Lazarus agitated when Alpa Chino (creator of booty juice) causes offense to the Australian people and culture. Don’t mess with the Australians. Oh shoot, I forgot, the actor is not really Australian. Is that cultural appropriation? I can’t wait until all of Australia, in unison, decide to mass meditate and channel their inner Crocodile Dundee. “Pump your breaks kid, that mans a national treasure”. Oh I know. I hope to see Australia, with the same spirit they fight off boxing kangaroos’ and wrestle with alligators, will come together and wrestle off their tyrannical government, building prison camps for the freedom loving people of Australia all over their beautiful (but spider infested) country. When you finally topple your tyrannical government (in as peaceful a manner as possible of course if any lawyer reads this) then rejoice by throwing some shrimps on your barby! Aussi Aussi Aussi! Let the rebuilding begin.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Native American tribes have cast a spell to protect tropic thunder from any scrutiny. Just like Reiner Fullmich and so many other freedom fighters enjoy protection from the spirits in the light realm. So you go ahead and see if you can break the protection spell and cancel this movie that is better than anything woke Hollywood could ever produce. Please, a female James bond? These are truly the end times. If there’s any humanities student from the university of Copenhagen who is appalled by my comparisons, I will just remind you that it was actually once allowed to make fun of our king and queen and our mommy in chief. Our economy breaking, family ruiner, mistress of misfortune not loving but only depressing. Our destroyer of once a nation, our national traitor (albeit if she’s found guilty in the courts) sitting at home, sipping her tea, reading her Shakespeare and pretending all is fine. Does she know the irony of reading Shakespeare? These are truly Shakespearean times. The life expectancy and birth rate is almost to match. Too harsh? Please don\'t punish me. I haven’t been indoctrinated enough, that’s all. I’m not suppose to question the matriarchy because we obviously live in a patriarchy, even though our prime minister is a women. Confused? Don’t be. You see, now you made her cry. Once the new world order is set in place, that will show me. I will be forced to recite feminist doctrines all day in a courtyard of fools. Walking to and fro in a contemplative state with people who thought we still had human liberties and fundamental rights. What in God’s name happened? Silly me. There’s even a guy who got his head cut off for trying to introduce free press into the kingdom of Denmark. He also slept with the queen which didn’t help. Huh, seems like that was important for some reason. But who needs that when you have state funded mainstream media constructing your reality matrix. Don’t eat that Neo! For goodness sake you may wake up and realize what’s going on around you. We can’t have that. Jesus, the predictive thought police, yes that’s actually real, are going to have a field day with me. So many wrong thoughts. Please don\'t give up on me, I can still conform. Mommy in chief are you still there? Don’t eat your liver pâté with rhubarb on rye bread when I’m talking to you. I can still change!</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If the universe decides, out of all the 1000 word articles I’ve written, that this is the one that will finally wake people up, then I will know the universe has a sense of humor. So please don\'t share this. I don’t want to be remembered for this kind of writing alone. Please universe, be dark and cruel and rid of any humor! I cannot bear being remembered as someone for wrote almost in shakespearian proses (maybe that’s pushing it) as the guy who did in depth analysis of the covid-19 crime against humanity by quoting Kirk Lazarus from tropic thunder. He even thought he was a black guy. Now, perhaps, it’s time for you to admit your mistakes and begin the process of reflection and of grief and reach a state of forgiveness. And rejoice. There’s always light and hope.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">I was for a brief stint, in 2020, getting psychiatric help. Gasp and horror that\'s why we don\'t have to listen to him! He certifiably loony. He even has the papers to prove it. Our ever so trustworthy WHO even says so. Whew what a relief, then we can go back to sleep. Let\'s continue reading and remember to roll your eyes every now and then. But please be careful your eyes don\'t roll out of your head (read back with danish sarcasm at it\'s finest).</p><p class="serif lh-lg">When the doors swung open into the psychiatric facility in Copenhagen, Denmark, I was filled with a bunch of stories about how professional and competent these people were, representing this fine institution. There reputation was flawless. Initially, the way it works is, you fill out a questionnaire, created by the WHO (not the danish government), in collaboration with a psychologist. Then they set up a round table of health professionals who will discuss what I answered on the survey. Notice how the human being, that would be me, is reduced to a questionnaire. Because why would they want to look me in the eyes? This is done so deliberately to loose all the nuances of a response with the written word and numerical scales. Are you suicidal and do you hear voices, takes on a whole other meaning when you see it represented in a survey, than when you actually take the time to talk to people. I do actually feel a little bit down today. Aha, then he’s clearly suicidal, you see it says so on the survey. At this point already red warning lights should be flashing, but let’s go on. I envisioned this round table having intense and heated debates about every last response from my survey. But I also know the reality of things. The people sitting around this table, more often than not, are picked for there job because they are agreeable people. But what you in reality want, is someone who could raise their hand in disagreement. You get the impression it’s hard to get a diagnosis, but in reality it’s very easy when everyone simply just agrees. Lunch time soon anyone? After all why do they care. It’s just another useless resource running through the system so big pharma can tell me to open wide, swallow their pills and become a perpetual customer. That it is good people hurting other good people only makes the devil laugh even harder as he has done in the past when we choose to make war with our brothers and sisters. I jokingly told a family member that they should do A/B testing on these questionaries from the WHO with healthy mental people thrown into the mix to establish a sound baseline. I think we would find that the WHO thinks everyone has a mental illness nowadays. They are the real ones in charge. Not just in psychiatry but also in the covid-19 pandemic.  They promised me they would have a sit down with my family to get a richer picture of me and my circumstances. They wouldn’t just base it on a questionnaire, heavens no. That was a flat out lie. That never happened. Probably because it would have contradicted the diagnosis I got handed straight down from the WHO. As a caveat, I later found out through a danish documentary, that once you have been given a certain diagnosis it cannot be removed from your medical journal ever again.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It became apparent after a while that their motives were different from mine. I couldn’t see myself in the diagnosis nor could my loved ones. I have a whole closet full of medication, yet I never consented even once to get the medication. I find it fitting that the crest of the field of medicine is a snake because they hope you are so anxious and weak mentally that you’ll then take it when you’re hope.  Just try it, it will make all your pain go away. They pressed it into my hand and I threw it into my bag pack, but I never forgot, and I reminded that every chance I could, that I did not consent to get the medication. Does that make it clear for anyone reading this and seeing this from the outside about the screwed messed up state of psychiatry? I sure hope so. By all means make up your own mind if your thinking getting help from these people, but if you want my opinion then whatever you do steer clear away from it. If you general practitioner refers you to a psychiatric facility then he lives in willful ignorance of what’s going on inside the walls. Don’t be fooled by someone wearing a lab coat. Many people, my sister Hannah, included have been hurt intentionally by big Pharma and it’s time they pay for what they’ve done (through the court of law).</p><p class="serif lh-lg">I went browsing solo for a while in search for better label, I mean diagnosis and stumbled upon Aspergers Syndrome. But I closed the chapter for good, of trying to get help from this field, when I learned that it was a eugenics project. Nobody wants to be at autistic, one end of the spectrum, but everyone wants to be an aspee. I never could figure out why all the experts talking about Aspergers nearly all had Aspergers themselves. And only highly intelligent and people we look up to in society probably secretly was a part of the club. A flattering diagnosis but not for me.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">2020 provided a much needed breathing room for many people. 2021 provided us with a choice, an opportunity to show our true colors, you could no longer hide. 2022 as the year everything clicked into place and I found myself through spiritual enlightenment. It provided me with a framework, a difference in perspective, a prism in which life is no longer just a life, but a like pearls on a string. Everything that is alive cannot die. You have a soul and it weighs 22 grams (roughly). You have lived many lives, you chose to come down and experience earth, maybe even to help if you now the current situation we find ourselves in. The spiritual component in psychiatry was intentionally swept under the rug because it would have given you so much power and inner strength that you wouldn’t have needed a magic bullet (pill) to get better. Your body is a complex chemical factory. A marvel to behold. Something to appreciate. I see clearly now that the way in which our society is structured is not stable. I was struggling because my ego was whispering in my ear I was stupid and worthless because I couldn’t fit in and do what everyone else did. It would have been easy if people around me didn’t think I had something to offer. He will become a professor one day don’t you know. Why then, when I love life and feeling the creative energies, can I not climb the pyramid that is our societies hierarchy. As Nikolai Tesla told us, if you want to know the secrets of the universe then you must understand light, sound and frequency. Climbing the ranks in our society does not correlate with intelligence, what is that anyways if the brain is only a switchboard and your real “intelligence” lie anchored in your immortal soul? Rather, the ability of climbing the ranks of society is indication of how ignorant, willful or otherwise, you are to the nature of our reality. For the people in the streets fighting for our fundamentals liberties, the human transition that will take place in 2022 will be smooth sailing. For the people who have lived in the ignorance of not knowing, of thinking they are better than there fellow counterparts (because they’ve been told that all the way through their many years of school) it is a bumpy road to learn that what they thought they knew was a lie or at the very least misleading. I encourage anyone who is struggling in these difficult trying times, not to seek help from psychiatry, but rather go the spiritual path and find out just how much you have to offer the world. The notes below provide an excellent starting point if you ask me. You’re an immortal soul and you have lived many lives. On this planet and probably elsewhere. You’re bright, intelligent and capable human being. I wish you well on your journey to enlightenment. May God and your spirit guides watch over you and may you have many experiences in this duality, of positive and negative experiences, that is life. </p>',

I harbor no ill will against you and I think, and pray, that there’s hope for a healthy recovery to the ones who took the vaccines. Please seek comfort, love and hope from friends and family in these difficult trying times. Now on to the ridiculousness that is our world governments desperately trying to raise the vaccine uptake because their global handlers were telling them to do so. They are not jokes, they actually happened. Check out the notes for yourself if you don’t believe me.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Free burgers. The former mayor of New York were enticing people with free burgers if they got vaccinated. Ask Michael Knowles from the Daily Wire commented so eloquently: "Come and get your slop you pigs”. It’s a good start, but we can do way better than that.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Free college. Again, the state of New York offered kids from the age 12-17 to enter into a raffle of winning free college but at the cost of their very lives. These vibrant and young energetic beings were lured with the promise and hope of a better future. It’s almost unbearable to imagine some kids willfully taking the offer not realizing they were lie to and now there health is potentially on the line. That is heartbreaking. Surely, that tops the list of the most dark ways young people have ever been lured into doing perhaps (but pray god hopefully not) irreversible damage to their health. After a brief moment of contemplation I think this tops the list for me. Because kids and I think teenagers stand no chance against providing informed consent. If there parents are informed properly then their children more than likely are not either. A promise of a better future in exchange for young and vibrant health. That is truly despicable.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Free Lap dance. The city of Las Vegas offered people free “special” services if people got vaccinated. In a strip club! I feel dirty even writing about this, but anything for a good laugh I guess.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Prostitution. It wasn\'t just the die hard capitalists who prostituted themselves to big pharma that needs to do some serious inward reflection and soul searching. The government of x allow a brothel to entice men to take the vaccine in order to get an appointment with a prostitute of their choice (no judgment passed). I imagine, God our creator, if this entity indeed is a man, to sit down these men, the sons of God, who took this offer willingly and tell them. Listen my son. Men are from mars, women are from venus, but nobody is that desparate to get some coitus with their penis (a master at work with his tool that is his words).  When I told people about it they didn’t believe me. I still don’t think they believe me. But look in the notes for yourself. Viewer discretion is advised, the picture in the article is the stuff of nightmares. You’ve been forewarned.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">These events are actually going to be written into some chapter in a history book. Remember the conspiracy to commit crimes against humanity that was the covid-19 planned pandemic? The audience of students will all nod in agreement, they definitely remember, it’s one of the biggest crimes against humanity to have ever taken place. Then some professor or teacher will tell them about the many absurd ways in which governments, like the poisoned apple in Snow White and the seven dwarfs, tried to trick people into getting a “vaccine” that was potentially lethal and getting people to play russian roulette with their lives and the lives of their children. The students would creep forward in the seat. People would shrug their heads. No they had never heard about those tricks. What were they? Well some governments actually went as low as trying to get people, men mostly, to take the “vaccine” through prostitution. Gasps will fill the crowded auditorium. No they definitely didn’t believe that. No way. Confidently the professor strutted over to his computer and flipped to the next slide. Then the auditorium went silent. People didn’t know what to think or feel. Throughout the whole pandemic everyone had been so manipulated and lied to that there moral compasses couldn’t guide them anymore in telling them what was up and what was down. But everyone in the room knew that this wasn’t all negative. This event in human history was a transition for humanity into a better existence, but for that to happen humanity had to learn from this very experience, each and every single one of their ancestors, for things to get better for humanity and for humanity to loose their slave masters which had kept them in chains.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Also, I have a bone to pick with my fellow danes. Why in Gods name didn’t we leave something for our future generation to have a laugh about. Why didn’t we disagree with the government in order to see how far they would go in order to get us “vaccinated”? I must say, I think we lost a golden opportunity there. I, for one, would have love to see our mommy in chief, our premier, offer us free prostitutes in order to get vaccinated. Imagine having that as part of our proud history. Shame on us for not uniting and making that our priority. Now, if you haven’t noticed, mommy premier is upset, no more nice mommy minister, so I don’t think will get that chance ever again in history. But predicting the future at this point would be equally ridiculous, so who knows. For anyone not danish who reads this, the mainstream media tried to win favor with the premier at the start of the pandemic by calling her mommy Mette. That is not a joke either, look in the notes if you need a good laugh. We all need a good laugh that raises our spirits and thereby our hope and chance of getting of the mess we currently find ourselves in.</p>',

Because you’ve been dipped in fear and your psychological health has been broken deliberately by the perpetrators behind this whole pandemic. They have tried to instill, through the very powerful mainstream media, that everything is hopeless and all is lost. But I’m hear to tell you it’s not. We’ve already won, now it is time to clean up the mess they made and rebuild with human value and dignity at it’s best, meaning no violence or destructive forces. Then we would have lost. Only love, peace and positive high frequencies can make the darkness surrounding europe once again go away. This may very well be your final wake up call. Put on your fitting spirit and help yourself and everyone you love and care about stand against tyranny. To think that you have no voice is to render yourself unable to enact the last final push for human liberation. Peaceful disobedience is also a great first step. Say no. Feel the power of not wearing a mask when your told because you stand in your truth, you’ve investigated the matter and in turns out it’s all just for show. There’s no scientific evidence. A great starter if you ask me, because they want us to wear the mask for symbolic reasons of showing obedience, that your willing to accept what you’re told even when you know it’s wrong.

You’re an intelligent, wonderful and loving human being with all the power in the world to turn this around. Join the peaceful protests around europe. Help extinguish the negative destructive energy with your light and positivity. It is never to late to stand in your truth. The first steps are always the hardest, but what will greet you if you do are loving and welcoming human beings for you to walk along side with as equals. This is truly history in the making and something to excitedly tell your grandchildren about one day once we have cleaned up europe and liberated our cities.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We’re not going back to the good old bad old days. What awaits us you and I get to decide if we so choose. In the notes you’ll find some footage of countries around europe protesting. The people realize that freedom is not a noun but a verb. Something never finished, never done. Something you must constantly take, something you must constantly become. If you’re still confused and left wondering what is going on in the world, then I encourage you, to once and for all, take responsibility of living your truth. Do not remain in the ignorance of not knowing why people are protesting, but the bliss is only temporary and life has given you a grand opportunity to step up to the plate (to use an american expression) and show the world your true colors. I’m one sentence away from going communist and calling you comrade but I won’t because I’m not a communist (nothing wrong with that of course). I stand against violence, so this is not an incident to do so. This is an attempt at a love declaration for the europe that has seen so many wars, pain and suffering to make you wake up at last and rather than using your passions for darkness, join the light and help use rebuild our society. Brick by brick, life by life.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Recently the president of France, one of the Rothschilds prodegies, and place on the throne as a strategic chess piece for the central banks and the 13 or so families running the world, recently showed his true self. Here’s some of his statements just this week and notice the fear, anger and resentment all very low frequency negative energies he is emitting in the hope of lowering your frequency and thereby the hope for change: “I’m not for pissing off the French… Now the unvaccinated I really want to piss them off. And so, we’re going to keep doing, until the end. This is the strategy.”</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The big bad boogie monster macron and the other pawns of the european governments will go away and loose power as soon as you turn off the mainstream media and listen in on where the actual conversations are taking place. I only make light hearted fun of the people in power who thought selling their soul and committing crimes against their fellow man would ever amount to anything remotely resembling a positive force for good. Maybe they should have embraced a cold shower of contemplation in the morning before venturing down this road leaving nowhere. When you choose to stand up and join and embrace your fellow man, and women, in the streets your fear and negative low frequencies will disappear and you will once again be in harmony and balance and feel love and excitement for how we are going to rebuild our societies. To piss Macron off specifically I will end this call to civil disobedience and peaceful protests by borrowing a phrase from the French revolutionists who fought for the fundamental freedoms and liberties that we enjoyed until yesterday: Vive la France! Vive l’Europe! I’m mean, the last people on earth to piss off if you look in the history books is the French. Sure, we europeans make fun of the French they eat snails, they make funny cars, they talk in weird accents oui oui, but at the end of the day we all know that deeply imbedded in the DNA of every man and women in France is the historical ancestral lessons of the French Revolution. We freedom loving people of europe stand with france stand with all our fellow europeans and the rest of the world in once and for all riding this darkness from the face of the planet earth. Your time, yes you reading this, is now. Feel the energy and power that held all this time but was suppressed! Now use the for a positive good!</p>',

The US military were on edge for the next (possible) imminent attack on the US mainland. Around 3 am sirens around the Los Angeles counties starting blaring and shortly after gunfire started to fire sporadically. Los Angeles, as seen through the eyes of the US military, was under attack. The sleepy residents of the city of Angeles concerned enough by the sirens and the gunfire would go out into the street. Numerous (eye witness accounts) people said they saw experienced a huge oval object in the sky. Film footage was recorded, along with pictures, in the newspaper following the next morning. Something was definitely there as confirmed by the sightings and the US military. I will argue it wasn’t a balloon, based in part, on the testimony of William Tompkins who was there that day and what he experienced.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">First and foremost, it is naive to believe we’re alone in the universe. We only have to look at the truly breathtaking numbers. There are billions of planets in the universe and billions of solar systems. Astrological findings would validate/agree, that the possibility of finding life (in whatever shape that may take) is significantly high.  //To suppose we’re alone in the universe is naive. William Tompkins was just a kid, when the Los Angeles sighting took place. He lived down by the Santa Monica pier. On the day of the event, he and another person went out on the balcony at night and saw a beam of light which peaked their curiosity. Then that beamed of light approached where they stood and flashed a light in their direction which illuminated everthing around them. Then, in a instance, the light disappeared. They didn’t think any further of the situation and proceeded to have dinner, listen to the radio and go the bed. The were woken by the sound of anti aircraft artillery which made them jump out of bed and into the streets like many other Angelenos and his witness testimony account deflates (no pun intended) the argument that the sighting could be explained away by being a balloon. How else could you explain the floating behavior of the craft?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The US navy also managed to shoot down two different smaller vessels not operated by any being inside supposedly. One shot down into the sea and retrieved. This sparked the beginning of the secret space program at Douglas. Also, right after this event took place was when W. Tompkins was contacted by the races that go by the name: Nordics.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">W. Tompkins was responsible for the redesign of the Apollo space program and was a key figure in getting people to the moon. He believed the reason for this sighting could have been to establish contact with other human beings in which he and others believe there are 1000s if not hundred of thousand. And Tompkins is by no means alone. In our neighboring country of Sweden a woman named Susan Bjorklund is in contact with a race of beings which go by the name: The Pleadians. And so many others.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The Los Angeles sighting challenges our belief systems. One the one hand, the people that saw the event up close clearly know it wasn’t a balloon. The argument falls to the floor quickly when you pierce the shallow headlines from the newspapers and radio at the time. In the beginning I found myself, when I began just recently digging into the larger question of whether we’re alone in the universe, to fallback to the mainstream media to help me uncover how my reality looks like. And even they and the US military would agree as early as 2017 that we have unidentified flying objects (UFO’s) which help support the case that we humans both Nazi fractions and the US military have had access to anti gravity vehicles since at least 1942. I hope this will help start a cascade effect in the minds of people out there reading this, that we’ve been told a lot of lies, perhaps even going as far back as six thousand years. And when you muster the courage to look into this yourself without first weighing the social repurcsion of thinking there is something to this, then you’ll find we’re not alone in the universe. We have access to incredible technology (but at present time only for the few not for the many) and that races from other planets are already in contact and helping us humans. Don’t believe everything hollywood has told you. Races from off planet are not only regressive and negative but also supportive and positive. Which is why nobody was afraid when the sighting took place and tragically the only people that died that day was people who were hit by the artillery shrapnel. If you open your mind, you’ll find amazing and wonderful events awaits us. You only have to look up at the night sky on a clear night.</p><h5 class="fw-bold fst-italic serif">Notes</h5><p class="serif lh-lg">[1] "William Tompkins: Selected By Extraterrestrials - Part One" Bitchute, uploaded by ProjectCamelot, 21 Nov. 2016, https://www.bitchute.com/video/JwZZ9dQLdI1M/ (47:40)</p><i class="serif lh-lg">I encourage you to assume responsibility for your own sense making and reality.

But you must learn how to crawl before you can walk, I hear a pedagogue say. Exactly, so why don’t we take these children by the hand help them utilize their untapped potential of wonder and fantasy and show them how to shape their ideas into reality. We can always teach them grammar. But motivation is key, especially when you’re young. Oh how exciting, I get a grade with a marker on it and a paper back with lots of red scribbles and question marks on it for me to edit and contemplate. I’m sorry, but this kills any creative imagination in a kid. In anyone for that matter. Let’s go to the marketplace of ideas. It’s like a bazaar where everyone is excitedly sharing from their hearts of hearts all the glorious and wonderful ideas they have. No idea is to wacky. Have you ever read Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll? Or an H.C Andersen adventure if your danish (no not the pastry)?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What does great writing look like? I’m glad you ask. Because one of the ways in which you become a great writer is to read a lot of books. You see how that works? Do you see how human beings help each other grow and evolve into becoming better and better versions of themselves. Let me unlock for you what has been deliberately kept from you. All the great writers through history. The greatest motivation you could ever need. You find a starting list in the notes below.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What do you think of when you think of a book? What kind of writing would deserve to bound in a book for people to pick of a shelf at a library and read? I better take extra care that my idea is compelling. That I get to the point and clear away any padding, any filling, that is unnecessary and does convey my point properly. The symbolism is strong and will stay with the children forever. Do you really think my thoughts and ideas are worth being wrapped up in book? Yes. I do. They learn to listen to their soul. They seek inward in moments of much needed contemplation with themselves. No, I’m not quiet satisfied with this argument here. I need to strengthen this point and convey its purpose more clearly. This paragraph feels out of place. The sentences do not quiet flow smoothly. I think this line needs to be rewritten with a better more clear word in mind that expresses what I think.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Motivation is often a factor when dealing with kids who needs to learn how to write and through that process learn how to think critically. I admit, looking back in my days at school, I had trouble getting motivated when I needed to write about a topic. Do you think Shakespeare would have been sufficiently motivated in modern day compulsory schooling, or do you it was something else was needed for him? Do your think H.C Andersen was motivated in school to become a great writer and thinker when he was forced, like many generations were, to learn and recite latin phrases? But you must learn to crawl before you can walk. Leave H.C Andersen alone, let him and help him unleash his creative imagination and you get some of their greatest children’s stories ever written. People come from afar to experience Denmark, to get a taste of the country where he was from. Still remembered and read to this day. They are so much more than children stories as we all know. The emperors wears no close has been adopted by many people around the world and used as a way to communicate when a group of people think one thing, when a single person sees everything for what it is. A naked emperors. Books is a proud part of the history of humanity. It is a symbol of collaboration when you write something of importance (to you and perhaps others) which can help people in the generations to come. What better motivation is their to become a great writer and thinker. When you segregate writing from it’s historical context as to why people wrote and were conveying ideas through this mechanism in the first place, then you compartmentalize children into a strict regime of writing papers in order to get a grade in return for your obedience to the task at hand. Great writers throughout history, if they were to have gotten a grade for their work, would probably all have gotten an F (-3 in Denmark). Because the greatest authors throughout history were often conveying very controversial ideas in his time, not fully appreciated by the masses and the people in charge of control. This happens usually after some years or decades or even a century has passed. Obvisouly the reason why you don’t want kids to learn how to write and to become great thinkers, is that it becomes a lot harder to control and manage obedience and compliance when you have trained children into becoming critical thinkers who can see through the managerial powers holding them in place in their designated layer in society. If this is shocking to you, that it the true purpose of schooling, then I would suggest becoming squinted with a school teacher for 30 years in New York City, a gentlemen known as John Taylor Gatto. The purpose of schooling is dumbing down, arguably, in order to make it easier to manage people, ie. Resources for the managers higher up in the pyramid structure. That is accomplished through what he [John Taylor Gatto] calls weapons of mass instruction. It is my belief that every single kid in a crowded classroom, has every single opportunity to become the next great author of our time. Genius really is as common as dust. But very few get to reach their full potential (their genius level capabilities) because it makes the whole societal structure shake to it’s very core if you truly educated kids into becoming independent and capable thinkers. Those people cannot be managed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Schools in the United States, and arguably in the west as a whole, is in dire need of a reform, and this is but one suggestion as to how we can make every kid in a classroom grow up with much needed capable leadership skills. I, for one, would much rather have a society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential as truly equal men and women under God, rather than having what we arguably currently have, people, myself included, who been under instrumentation, that is schooling, that has dumbed us down and kept us in extended childhood, never been allowed to grow up. But this, as well as the rest of our societies in need of reform, will very soon change. And if you have kids you will hopefully see the grow up and become wickedly smart and capable human beings in a new system of education, rather than forced compulsory schooling. Because, though the powers at be, would like to equate school with education, they are separate. And an education is what you can give yourself, each and every one of us, when we assume responsibility for our own understanding of the universe. What may I hope? What ought I do? What is man?</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">Being seems exhausting enough without factoring in the future of the human race. The history of humanity may surprise you. The present events unfolding, seemingly at rapid speed. Government officials breaking human rights violations, in particular the UNESCO agreement made after the WW2 atrocities and the Nuremberg (1.0) trials. The future is worth being excited about when we take a closer look at what we have to look forward to in the not so distant future, once we have weathered the storm, stronger and more united than ever. Weaving a tapestry of past, present and future, from perviously unseen angles, will allow us to catch a glimpse of what the human race will transition into. If we wake up and adopt self responsibility that is. Otherwise a group of other folks will gladly lead us into the most tyrannical totalitarian system the world has ever seen. Reason enough to wake up, I suppose. If not for you then the next generation to follow.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">For some people, having their world being turned upside down is rather unpleasant. But I thought our government had our best interests at heart, first and foremost our health and well being. It’s uncomfortable to learn that they are just towing the line for the real small fraction of people in charge of this whole planned operation that is covid-19. But before jumping into that, I would like you to join me on a journey back in time, to ancient Egypt. In a time where pharos reigned, sometimes with cruelty, over the jewish people.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The “Custodians” of the homo sapiens, that would be us, is a term borrowed by William Bramley in his book: Gods of Eden. We, as a collective, haven’t really had time to go into details about the many findings of our past and what they mean for the current understanding of our races. The intelligent design hypothesis along with archeological findings including the Cambrian explosion and the invention and adoption of DNA would seriously question that previously unquestionable in evolutionary biology, Darwins theory of Evolution. There is no evidence of evolutionary progression from ape to man (homo sapien). Another idea, namely the intelligent design hypothesis takes hold when we factor in DNA as the source code the creator(s). It seems very likely when reading biblical texts like Genesis and others carefully, that the human race was a slave race and our so called custodians where as a matter of fact a malevolent race from another world. They saw human beings as a resource to be exploited, a little like we saw horses in the nineteenth century as a means of getting around the country. It’s a long way to fall from the epistles at the universities who have taught and who think we are all alone in the universe, that it couldn’t be further from the truth. Both malevolent as well as benevolent beings from other worlds exist. Human beings have been kept in chains. Only the kings and queens, the pharos and popes of our time, as well as the occult secret societies have been allowed to communicate and thereby know the true history of humanity. Therein lies the story once told that the king held the connection to god. The custodians are not gods, but you can see why our ancestors thought so. Technically advanced beings flying around in described cigar shaped and spherical balls of light. Descriptions since ancient times of flying boats and these exact shaped flying objects. </p><p class="serif lh-lg">Putting our current world events into perspective you would see that what were going through is a seismic paradigm shift. Humanity is loosing it’s chains. We’re becoming aware of who we are. There are apparent good news to report and get excited about. Our “custodians” are gone. They have been defeated by beings of the light. I will leave it to prominent figures to explain the exact details of the story, I will just skim for the sake of brevity. Though our other worldly “custodians” are gone, we still have human beings at the top of our pyramid structured society sitting with the schematics as to how to enslave humanity once again, more brutal than ever. So, this is where I believe we find ourselves. As with covid-19 and so many other things, including our very own history, we’ve been lied to. We need to come to terms that we’ve been a slave race for many years. We need to come to terms with what that means as to our self understanding and our place in the universe, because that is not centric in nature, but actually more like way out in the desert where only dustballs roll about taken by the wind from time to time. I’m of course talking about our place in our solar system. Down town should apparently be very busy, are we ready for that? I think we are. The alliances of benevolent other world races who have helped us apparently has a very clear message. They helped us and defeated and liberated us from our custodians. You’re welcome. Now it’s time that we rise up in unisons and loose our human captors. I believe we can do it and are doing it as we speak.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The Nuremberg 2.0 trials (we must find a better name, I’m sure we can come up with something) are set to begin very soon. Spearheaded by Reiner Fullmeich, a list of competent human beings, including Michael Yeadon have amassed and collected enough evidence to put the criminals behind the crimes against humanity we call the covid-19 planned pandemic and the vaccines and restrictions on human freedom away for ever. Too many people have woken up already. Look at Austria, Australia, Germany, not to mention Denmark, though we’re a small country of course, we have a loud voice and an important role to play still. When we defeat our human captors who are trying to keep us enslaved, then we will rejoin with the rest of the universe, we will get to know our true history in full technicolor. We will slowly rebuild our society with human dignity and values placed in the very heart, the very center of all decisions. No more outside intervention from other malevolent beings and no more collusion behind our back from our own race for their own selfish gains. We have so much to look forward to. So if you need a reason to wake up and join in the (peaceful) fight for our freedom back, then I can’t think of anything more encouraging than that.</p>',

Can you hear how it rhymes with the lessons of the past? I would tell you in reply, with all the love in my heart, who has the time to repeat these God awful lessons? By adopting responsibility now for your own sense making you’ll actually gain free time in the long run (emphasis on free, not living live in various mastering forms of slavery). This experience will keep being presented to humanity until we learn, each and every single once of us, what it means to take responsibility for our own lives. Not live by what socialist planners are telling us but rather live life as free men and women. Free to make choices over our own body (think that is called bodily autonomy if I may be so cheeky). Free to spend your money and thereby your free time on whatever you want. Free to travel, free to speak your mind (which clears up the fog in your mind and makes you able to think clearly), free to not live life by what controllers and socialist planners are telling you what to do, but by what you want to do. Like an atom is the building block of the universe, so an individual is the building block of society, the fundamentals way of which to organize society. Not the collective. It has never worked in the past and will never work in the future.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The end (all that is living must take the vaccine and the boosters in the future with no end in sight) justifies the means (the coercive, and illegal, measures applied to people who will not comply and refuse to get vaccinated). When the end justifies the means, putting a lockdown in place on an entire country, even though there are evidence that this will have the opposite effect of health and safety, becomes justified. When the end justifies the means, people loosing their jobs and committing suicide, becomes justified. When the end justifies the means censoring dissenting voices of doctors, scientists and people from all walks of life with a different perspective, becomes justified. When the end justifies the means is an extremely dangerous when power is concentrated in the hands of central planners. Do you get it yet? How many more examples of this do we have to go through in the future. When the end justifies the means, preventing the “unvaccinated” (whatever that means to the planners) from living in society (period) becomes justified. Have we really come to this? Do you really think your safe because you’ve done what the planners (ie. Your government) has told you what to do? There is no safety in collectivism, it is but a fleeting moment, when you have no individual human being with morals to scruple. No one in sight and no one to comfort you when the planners realize they made a mistake and are not willing to go any further with the methods they threaten to employ to reach the end. An end is insight but it is not the “vaccines”. Because they are not “vaccines” (if I have left the vaccine word bare without quotations in an article, please let me know). A vaccine is suppose to protect you from a virus. These do not do that and even the planners are telling us this at this point. They are a mechanism for something else. And you deserve to know what you put into your body. You’re a sovereign individual who made a mistake. We all do. But it is important that we learn this one especially. The people at the top tow the line and individuals with morals who would disagree, ask questions and offer different perspectives, have long left. If you don’t comply to the collective then you’re put in opposition and called a slew of words we’re all readily familiar with at this point (I don’t even have to write them up, they are seethed into our minds).</p><p class="serif lh-lg">A scary moment of realization is when you look around and see that everyone has been delegated to very specific sets of tasks (in true Prussian schooling style) and some are blindly following orders. A doctor or nurse who think they are not responsible for the crime the are committing. It’s the collective, the faceless institutions that bare responsibility. But when the truth comes out, who is to blame, who is responsible will be passed around amongst the people who committed these very crimes. People reducing themselves to just following orders are extremely dangerous because they lack a moral philosophy in life. Where did the hippocratic oath go. If you’re squeamish, look away now, do not read the next sentences in my attempt to make this lesson painfully clear. When the German soldiers marched to the middle of the forest and stood on the crest of a crater with a loaded gun and decided to shoot innocent children and babies with women screaming frantically trying to shield them from the hail of bullets ripping through their bodies in the fraction of an instant, just following orders wasn’t an excuse. How could the soldiers shoot innocent children? How can you inoculate a child with something that will almost certainly destroy his health (maybe even kill him, God forbid)? When doctors and nurses who inoculated men, women and children with these vaccines are just doing their job, some of them knew but some didn’t know what they had done, that is no excuse either. How dare I make such a horrid comparison! If invite you to see the following interview with Vera Sharev. This article isn\'t going anywhere. That is the lesson humanity is going through once again. The adoption of responsibility for ones action. Every single one of them. Do you hear the church bells tolling away in the distance because the death rate around the world has risen by 40% above normal (10% is considered a catastrophe)? Then see it as a sign for you to wake up. How do you want to be remembered? A silent desk killer? Someone who simply took marching orders? Are you taking full responsibility for your actions you doctors and nurses of Denmark? How will we ever trust you ever again? Do you know what’s in the vaccines? Are you an active member of the discussion of health and safety concerns of the vaccines? Have you ever seen one of these vaccines under a microscope? How come I probably, as many other lay people do, know more about these vaccines than you do? Could it be by design? I even attended a three day weekend conference in a frantic attempt to help my mom and my little sister who took the vaccines in the good faith that they were safe and effective. This is not a threat (period), but whoever inoculated these two people in my life with an experimental “vaccine”, will be held accountable. I will make it my life mission if I have to, to make it painstakingly obvious to you that just following orders is not an excuse. I hope by now this message has been seared into your brain, just like mainstream media tried to sear into our brain to be good and obedient citizens and take the vaccines to get back to normal. Look around you, we’re no where near going back to normal, not ever. Throughout history once government has taken and put restrictions on your life they have never willingly given them back again. My message of hope to all (especially the people who got the “vaccines”) is that one of the biggest trials in the history of humanity is set to begin. The crimes committed against you, and every single one of us, will be exposed and facts will be put out in the open for everyone to see. This too shall pass and we will rebuild once we rid this darkness from planet earth. But first you must ask yourself. What enabled Hitler and others like him to get to power? How about Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini or Mao? Why is it the worst get on top? Why not someone like you and me, for the good of humanity? Time for you to roll up your sleeve and figure that one out for yourself. Luckily, our history is filled with examples for you to go explore.</p>',

Masks are used as a symbol, above all else including health and safety, to indicate obedience, and compliance, to the controllers. Masks do not protect you nor anyone else from catching covid-19. It’s an anti-life agenda, designed to dehumanize you. A face is no longer an interface used for conversing when you can’t see the human being behind the mask. It prevents you from getting oxygen to your brain, so masks actually damage your health. You inhale oxygen and exhale carbon-dioxide (CO2), but when you wear a mask the latter cannot escape so you actually inhale back into your lungs what you were suppose to exhale. Which can, and almost certainly will, cause damage to your lungs and thereby your health. It is a test to see how scared, and for the matter our society is. How many are wearing a mask? How many actually now that it is a symbol? Why wear something for symbolic reason. Would you know that the pandemic was still going on if people weren’t wearing masks when you go out shopping for groceries for instance. Masks damage your health. It is written into our (danish) legislation that if you feel any sort of discomfort you can take it off. The controllers hope, of course, that you are to afraid to do so, because of the social pleasure applied to conforming to ever changing sets of, in my opinion, absurd doctrines. The first time is always frightening. Do your own research on masks first, know the rights you have in your country and then take it off the next time you go out shopping for instance. Then you become a powerful symbol of hope and human freedoms to other who may be on the fence of stepping into their true self.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to PCR-Testing. The CDC (center of disease control) in the United States just recently went out and said that the PCR-Test cannot distinguish between the common flu and covid-19. Nations, including Denmark, have spend so much money on our PCR-Testing equipment. And it doesn’t work. The inventor of the PCR-Test as late as 2019 went out and said it can only be used in a research laboratory setting, with a low risk of bacterial contamination. I’m sorry to inform you, but the swaps that they’ve put in our noses and into the back of our throws is dipped in a radioactive chemical substance known to cause cancer. Do not take anymore PCR-Tests. Do not comply. Demand from your government that they show up to the table for a sound discussion on the scientific evidence which would suggest that the PCR-Tests work. CDC just swept the entire basis for locking down our country from under our feet. If the PCR test is not valid then we have no basis for locking down entire countries. Everything we went through the last two years. The numbers they showed us in the mainstream media. Pouring our entire economy down the drain. It was all based on the PCR-Test.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no lockdowns. The PCR-Test was the flawed data that was used to shut down entire nations and economies (read above paragraph about the PCR-Test). All the way back in march 2020, scientist and doctors went out and warned against shutting down entire countries. That it would, as a matter of fact, have the opposite effect. Which it did. Many people have committed suicide. Economies are tanking, despite our prime minister stating in her New Years address to the nation that it’s stronger than ever. Do not comply with a lockdown from these corrupt government and politicians of your country. Read up on the Great Barrington declaration if you want an answer as to why lockdowns have to opposite effect. They’ve never been put in place until the covid-19 pandemic. The intended goal from the controllers was to isolate you which would have the effect of making you anxious and scared of the invisible weapon (to the naked eye) that is the covid-19 virus. This would . This is the mass formation (psychosis) tactic employed almost in sync throughout the world. You would do anything, including taking an experimental “vaccine”, to make the pain go away and get back to normal. We’re not going back to normal. We will rebuild and rid this darkness from the planet earth and it’s start by you saying no. Join in demonstrations against lockdown. Demand more from your government. They are just people like you and me, remember.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to health pass. There is no health reason what so ever to introduce a health pass. There is no reasons what so ever to connect your health pass to your bank account. But it is quiet telling what world the controllers are pulling you in once you realize that it wasn’t about your health but always about control (go figure) of you and your assets and one way to do that is through the health pass. In their dystopian world, in order to access your money, you need to be up to date on your boosters. Did you have an adverse reaction? Too bad. It says in your health pass you’re unvaccinated (shame on you) because you’ve only had 5 boosters and not 6. Do you miss the good old bad old days when you thought you had bodily autonomy. When you thought you could still be a part of society? How does it feel to have no control over your body anymore? Do not comply with the health pass. If not for you then for your kids. Leave them a world were they still have control over their own bodies and financial assets. If this gets introduced (they are working diligently on it as we speak) it is the end of human liberty and freedom as we know it. Demand your rights back. Demand the people in your government who stripped you of these rights to be held accountable in the trials to come.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to “vaccines”. They are not “vaccines”. They do not protect you against covid-19. They are a part of a much bigger plan (see health pass paragraph above). Do not be tricked and manipulated by them anymore. Do not live in fear, embrace love and hope. Together we will turn this around and bring about a brighter future and it starts with you. Stand up and demand to know what is in the vaccines from your government and health officials. Do not give this to your kids. Become a mommy bear and papa bear who will protect them at all cost.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to restrictions. Do not let them take away your rights. Think about what kind of a planet we’re leaving for the next generation, seriously. When you finally stand up to your bully, you’d feel a lot better. Each time we comply to their restrictions on life, the people behind this planned pandemic are laughing at us. You’re so much more than what the planners and controllers think of you. They are afraid of you. They are afraid that you will get of your knees and embrace your fellow man in the street in the demand for justice and a trial for the atrocities committed. I do believe they events will become more and more absurd and that is a part of the final awakening of humanity. See what is happening around you as an opportunity every single day to step into your true self and stand tall. You and I have all the power in the world to turn this around. And it starts by saying no.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">I’m trying to embrace the idea of a line of finite length with two opposing arrows from opposite sides, the vaccinated and unvaccinated  with a center point in the middle representing unity. I’m confident that the unvaccinated are already very close if not already at the center point. They know what’s at stake. The vaccinated, however, are a different story. Some are all the way at the start of the line, in complete polarity and opposition. The arrow hasn’t moved an inch. The vaccinated have to meet the unvaccinated half way. You have to willingly want to understand what’s going on. You have to willingly want to unite with the people who chose not to be vaccinated. I didn’t take the vaccine. You may think, why should I care about the ones that did? Why not just let them learn by experience what awaits them when the time is ready? Because this is one of the biggest crime against humanity and they deserve to know the injustice and the crime committed against them and perhaps even their children. That is enough reason for me to try, like so many others, to see how we can unite and meet at the middle.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What awaits us if we unite is a future worth living in. One where men and women are free. If we are unable to be as one, we will become enslaved in the most tyrannical and dark new world order global banking system that will make you wish and regret that you didn’t do more when the time was right. In the notes you’ll find some, I believe, compelling evidence which suggest our world leaders are pulling us in this direction. The time to act is now, and it is not too late to pull up a chair and join the discussions about how we can combat this attack on human liberties and fundamental rights.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">When our compass at sea is going bezerk and the arrow is pointing both north and south seemingly all at once, it’s important to ground ourself in some basic human rights, before proceeding steering the ships that is our world governments.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The people behind this crime, would arguably say that the people who took the vaccines don’t deserve to live because they are useless. People have free will. No one was physically forced. They did it to themselves. I think in their screwed up human morals they believe that it justifies their claim that there are too many people on earth who are just blinding following orders and don’t think and therefor don’t deserve to live. If you think this is a sickening way to look at your fellow man, I would agree. But unfortunately these are some of the people at the top, steering the ship, and giving our governments read made talking points, instructing what to say and when to say it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">I think the people who got the vaccine and now regret it because they see through the lie that we were going back to normal, and as our danish government told us, it was a super weapon, need a confidence booster. Do not blindly follow orders from these people. Instead look to your fellow man in the exact same position as you whether you believe it or not. It is the end of the road, final call, for living life as a free man, if these new measurements are put in place. When the trap shuts with a loud snap and you look around and you find yourself in a world where your body is connected a global banking system, the government controls where you can go and when, then it will be too late to do anything. I’m sorry but that’s the hard truth.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The reason why the people behind the curtain orchestrating this has been able to get away with stripping us from our basic rights, is because they do it incrementally in the hope you won’t see what they are up to. If you have a cat, have you ever seen it chase after a bird that landed on the ground. Immense focus and concentration on the target and small incremental steps towards your goal until you get so close that you’re ready to pounce. Will just remind people that the light always wins over the darkness. The bird saw the cat and flapped merely away. We are winning this psychological war that is roaring in the minds of people. You give them just one small bite and they’ll take your entire hand.  The storm will be over a lot quicker when we get together and unite.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In Denmark, our government even went out and said that they had failed and so did a mainstream media organization. When do we realize that this is the signal for you to switch off the mainstream media and join in discussion with your fellow man. We all have the same interest. None of us wish to be torn apart, as a people and as a nation, but it’s a very old war tactic employed through the mainstream media. Divide and conquer your enemy has worked wonders ever since Machiavelli and the Roman Empire. What you have to ask yourself is this. Why do I feel divided? Where does that believe come from? And most importantly, if your feeling is of mutual agreement that we should approach unity and become one once again, how do we combat it? What does it take for you, for instance, to be willing to pull up and have a conversation, or hear an in-depth conversation, with an unvaccinated or a doctor or scientist who holds a difference of opinion not allowed on the mainstream media? The question of credibility comes up again and again in the mainstream media. Are you getting your information from a question from a credible source, is a slab in the face to the people who trusted the expert and government officials who told them to take a “vaccine” that was cloaked as an experimental gene based therapy. The good news is the people who told them to take the vaccine lied, which is not allowed under the laws of the universe, universal law. So anyone who took the “vaccine” had no way of providing informed consent regardless of what they will claim, in a desperate attempt to evade the crimes they committed against you.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start"> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second day for doctors for COVID ethics gold standard symposium. We\'re going to start off this morning talking about something that came up a lot when we were covering both health and economics yesterday. And that is the propaganda matrix. And I\'m delighted to be joined by a wonderful group of journalists and publishers, people, and one academic people who know journalism and know communications. So let me just introduce you to our four panelists. First, we have and I have to thank him, Brian, I have to thank you for UK columns role in putting on this gold standard symposium. We have Brian garish, who after a successful career in the Royal Navy, Navy decided to do something about what was going on in the world. And the next thing he did was he discovered himself as a publisher in the media business.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And then we have Taylor hudak, who joined us last night as a moderator. Today, she\'s with us as a panelist, and she is one of those up and coming young journalists who\'s really doing amazing things on several websites, one in Munich, and then the American arts, the last vagabond, I believe, and, and Taylor has served doing communications for the doctors of COVID ethics, and so has a very unique perspective. We\'re also joined by Professor Michael Meyer, from the mind from the University of Munich. He says he\'s from academia. But I also know he has a little bit of journalistic experience in his background, but he\'s going to bring a more, I would say, a higher minded perspective, the rest of us are in the trenches. And then we have Patrick henningsen, from 21, at 21st century wire, who also does a show with UK column news and has a long and very distinguished career covering international politics, geopolitics, and I think has a very good sort of overview of the whole situation anyway. So ladies and gentlemen, welcome.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> I\'m going to start off by asking each of you to make a three and a half minute statement. And then we\'re going to have a bit of a response in a discussion. And, Brian, again, special thanks to you for your role in making this symposium possible. So let\'s start off with you. Well, thank you, thank you very much for inviting me and giving me this opportunity to speak were shorter time. So I\'m going to go very quickly. But I\'m going to say that for the last 10 years in particular, we\'ve been looking at something we think very dangerous unfolding in UK and that\'s the use of applied behavioral psychology in order to get political agendas through. This has now culminated in in the fact that we\'ve we\'ve had all of the chaos surrounding the COVID-19 policy in the lockdown and the resulting so called vaccination policy, that\'s all been happening. But we\'ve kept our eye very much on what\'s been happening with applied behavioral psychology. Now, a few people have used the term propaganda, they say that what we\'re seeing around the psychology is propaganda. That is, that\'s true. But we\'ve got to go deeper. And we\'ve actually got to be considering that the British government and this is this extends worldwide but if I just focus on the UK at the moment, we\'re talking about the use of psychology on the wider public but also on people in positions of authority. So within the local government councils in UK, within the police within education, even the members of parliament themselves have been subjected to this very pernicious applied behavioral psychology. Now, the oranges of this go back many, many years, we can go back to Tavistock, the Tavistock Institute, the Frankfurt School even, we can be looking into the 1930s 1940s. But essentially the period where we began to see this on the rise, we\'re looking around about the year 2000 when we started to see people coming close to British government, in order to advise them on how to use psychology to get political agendas through. And interestingly the first department it affected was the Department for environment and Rural Affairs. That was when we had another so called pandemic of foot and mouth. 11 million animals very cruelly killed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> But the Behavioural Insights Team inside that department spread across government became the Behavioural Insights Team alongside the Cabinet Office in UK. And then what have we seen over recent years, we\'ve seen the experts inside that bit team behavioral insight team, working with, amongst others, the French. And we particularly tracked a gentleman called Olivier earlier, who was part of salt cozies inner circle. And there were a number of meetings set up where British and French experts met to join to discuss how they were going to get applied behavioral psychology working both in the UK and in France. Now, where does that take us? That takes us to the fact that we can now show we can prove there\'s no theory here, that the Applied Psychology has been brought directly into all matters to do with COVID. And the vaccine. And the worst example I can give our audience today is the minutes from 22nd of March last year from the government scientific team called the sage team in which they were discussing using fear using stress and anxiety in order to get people in the UK to adhere more to the government\'s COVID-19 policies. So they were going to use fear. And they were also going to turn community members against each other in order to use the community relationships for people to police each other, either by encouragement or by criticism. So that is the situation as we speak in UK, Applied Psychology, the public completely unaware of it, the British government boasting that it can change the way people think, without them understanding what\'s happening. It even says in its 2010 document mindspace people may know their behavior is being changed, but they won\'t know how we\'re if they realize it\'s being changed, they still won\'t fully understand how it was done. This is now expanded across Europe, and the technologies been sold to the US and Australia. This is the danger not just COVID and vaccination, but applied political psychology alongside it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Thank you very much, Brian. Let\'s turn now to Professor mind. Your perspective as someone looking at this from the academic and the research side from the University.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> I\'m delighted to be here, and especially delighted with the title of this panel. Again, the matrix is a title of my new book published last week. So it\'s the right place to be for today. I have just two points. First, why did state and commercial media defines the reality of the pandemic, not alternative media? And second, why do we not have any false state journalism beyond independent platforms like UK column, vida journalists follow governments using Applied Psychology this was a binds point point right now, my first points in media reality of the pandemic. The traditional media BBC, for example, as a memory of society, the shared backhaul knowledge. Alternative Media, like UK column are not part of CES knowledge, even this conference will not become part of it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> That means nobody has to care what we talk about here as long as we not reach the level of key media, like BBC of traditional media. Using King media people observe power relations, who has the power to define reality, with the power to shape society\'s knowledge. So people don\'t have to believe in key media reality is enough to believe in key media effects. In my academic discipline and communication, we talk about influence of presumed influence, influence of presumed influence. This concept has three pillars first, people know that everybody else knows about media reality, knowledge of society. Second, people believe in media effects and serve because of one and two people adapt to King media\'s reality. That\'s what we could observe in the corner cases. In Germany we had and we have a very uniform reporting in the key media. It\'s all about the killer viral story. Some critics say we would have no pandemic without the tests, I say we would have no pandemic</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Make this key media journalists doing their job. The job of journalism is not to promote government policy. Quite the opposite.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> By the journalism fair, my second point it\'s I think it\'s all about dependencies about economic and political dependencies. He media are among the winners of the pandemic. First, they got new financial resources, state subsidies and Romney paid ads, lots of ex pregnancy audience came back. In an age of fear and anxiety. People seek safety in official holds official knowledge in official news. And last but not least, as a government\'s help to fight challenges, especially alternative media, blocking channels, deleting videos, freezing bank accounts, observing free and independent journalists via the Secret Service, source and power started the kind of cyber war in order to suppress all non hegemonic information. And in this work, he media a very powerful ally. The lessons that we have to have to learn this is my final sentence is quite simple. We need media without commercial and political dependencies are nonprofit organizations with transparency, the social monitoring is a different media ethics. It\'s a long way, of course, and I think we have to start the public debate on media ownership as a today\'s and tomorrow\'s. Thank you.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Thank you. That\'s a book I\'m ordering. That Frick. Thank you. Thank you, Katherine. Just to follow on from what my other panel colleagues said, I\'d like to comment on the coordinated fashion of, of the propaganda that we were witnessing, it\'s coordinated globally. The streamlining of the messaging, even the policy itself, the attacks against dissenters, the fact checkers that have been deployed the deep platforming, by Silicon Valley by big tech. This is like a war effort, and it\'s in its global context is totally unprecedented in history, even to the point now, where the media is working with government institutions to effectively single out and marginalize, quote, anti vaxxers as a kind of crude pejorative term, in particularly vicious fashion. So what started off as ostensibly a sales and marketing campaign for the transnational pharmaceutical, industry or cartel, if you will, has accelerated into something much more pernicious. And, you know, accusing, for instance accusing the quote unvaccinated as being akin to murders as the US President Joe Biden had recently said in commented, the or California Governor Gavin Newsom, comparing the unvaccinated to drunk drivers as a public health hazard. So this is the sort of hyperbolic language that\'s being effectively weaponized. Through propaganda from the government media complex, I say government media complex, because these two institutions are working hand in glove and across borders now. And they\'ve effectively polarized society in recent months. And at worse, the segregating a minority in a manner reminiscent of some of the worst periods of recent history, particularly mid 20th century, Germany, as an example, or in a sectarian country as extreme sectarian or tribal divides. So throughout this shameful saga, the mainstream media has been an enabler and has shown little restraint in attacking those who are considered dissident to government policy. So by combining forces directly between government and the press, the fourth estate has effectively become a fifth column, which is being weaponized against against the people themselves. And if you want to look at the actual data of this, it\'s very clear now, the the drop in advertising just in the UK alone, during the first lockdown, something like a loss of 1.1 billion pounds in advertising spend across all the major industries. And that was really picked up by the government itself, who then became the biggest advertiser. As Michael has commented previously, during that period, almost 50% more than the next biggest corporate spender, which was Unilever.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Corporation. And so in addition to this, this was a effectively propaganda campaigns paid for by the government subsidizing all of the mainstream media, mainstream corporate media outlets. And the government struck a 119 million pound deal for COVID advertising weeks before the first lockdown. That\'s according to the UK Daily Telegraph newspaper, that was reported in October of 2020. So there was an advanced plan, if you will, to roll out this propaganda, which as Brian garish, previously commented is, is predicated on weaponized applied behavioral psychology. So, UK Government pandemic advertising in 2020, alone, it tops a quarter of a billion pounds. So this is not these are not trivial sums of money, and some of the worst type of propaganda you\'ve ever seen a very manipulative, definitely attacking the disposition of members of the public, coordinated across every outlet. In terms of messaging, you can just look at a few examples, pick out any day of the year, and you\'ll see completely streamline messaging across all media outlets. The public has never had to face anything like this in history, not in the West, anyway. And to top it off, if you want to look at the civil society sector, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Corporation.

The public has never had to face anything like this in history, not in the West, anyway. And to top it off, if you want to look at the civil society sector, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, up to June 2020. And ploughed something like $250 million in foundation grants into mainstream media outlets, like the BBC, NBC AlJazeera, pro publica, The Guardian Univision, financial times the Atlantic just to name only a few. So this adds another feature to the propaganda rollout, the complete coordination and this is the same Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that is subsidizing the r&d for the vaccine development. And has marshaled one particular project, I believe that\'s the Oxford vaccine or the AstraZeneca vaccine, but is subsidizing effectively global manufacturing. So there, there is a conflict of interest there on a level that is even on comprehensible. And just to round this off, this crisis is being articulated in a national security context, more and more now we hear the rhetoric. So it\'s worth pointing out that the g7 nations in June of 2018, had initiated what is called the rapid response mechanism, the RRM. And this is an agreement between all g7 nations that they will be of single mind that there\'ll be a single messaging in any particular crisis, that there will be no variations from their agreed narrative. This is the rapid response mechanism. This was initiated by then Prime Minister Theresa May, and this is covering the g7 nations, this is initially said to counter Russian disinformation at the time or enemy disinformation or propaganda. But now we can see that this is exactly what has happened throughout the duration of the COVID crisis. So that that brings it into a geopolitical context to show the level of coordination is unprecedented. And it\'s global. In that respect.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Patrick, thank you, they always say follow the money. What we heard yesterday, again, was this notion of plans being made well before the beginning of the pandemic, and in many different fields. So these are serious questions about the propaganda matrix. So now Taylor return to you. Take it away.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Thank you for having me. It\'s a pleasure to be here. Now, it is, of course, the role of the media to hold power to account and to hold the establishment to account. And unfortunately, what we are seeing here with this covid 19 crisis is that the media in particular, the mainstream media is doing the groundwork and the PR for the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the corrupt public health industry. And what I find extremely problematic here is that, as we all know, sitting here on this panel, it is our job as media professionals to basically inform the public and our duty is to the public. Instead, our associates I guess, in the mainstream media are encouraging people to make an irreversible health decision, and they\'re only providing them certain types of information in one side of the story here. And so that\'s why it is so important that independent media really plays a strong role.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And uplifting the voices of the doctors who are part of say doctors for COVID ethics and those who are speaking out. And I\'ll get to that in just a little bit here. But we know that the propaganda is unfortunately quite effective. One thing to remember is that just a year and a half ago, we did not know the terms PCR test or flatten the curve or social distancing. So we see these public health terms and phrases being used in everyday vernacular, again, pointing to how strong this propaganda is.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And of course, the media has been instilling fear in the public, and the media propaganda has also caused people to become fearful of one another, and to also police each other. This is very problematic as it is very reminiscent of what we have seen in the past with totalitarian regimes, and also to it creates a social hierarchy. as Patrick henningsen was saying, the mainstream media is demonizing unvaccinated people blaming the so called surgeon COVID cases and hospitalizations on unvaccinated people. And essentially, those who are vaccinated are becoming fearful of those who choose not to get the job. So we\'re seeing this division. And it\'s important to also remember that the establishment benefits from our division.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And again, I\'m sorry.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Okay. And again, I want to also emphasize the importance of the doctors who we have really relied on here to provide us with the facts and the science and the truth when it comes to COVID-19. The vaccines and this particular virus, because many of them are demonized in the media. And it reminds me of many of the whistleblowers who speak out john Kiriakou spoke out against the CIA and so many others. And what happens to them is that they are demonized, they are smeared and it comes to a great risk to not only their careers and their personal lives, to speak out and provide us with the truth. So I do want to thank the doctors and medical professionals associated with doctors for COVID ethics, it\'s been my pleasure to work alongside all of you. And I could tell you that each week, each of these doctors are risking so much again to provide us with the truth and the facts here. And again, it\'s been my pleasure to be a part of this. And I just would encourage everybody that\'s independent media is the future. So that\'s the positive here. More and more people are turning away from the mainstream media, the viewership has declined quite significantly over the past 10 years. And specifically, within the past five years, people are also turning to social media to receive their news, which does somewhat tie into independent media. But again, it goes back to the funding model, independent media is funded by viewers Well, the establishment media, mainstream media is funded by the very people that they are meant to hold to account. So I think that the future can look bright if we put more of a focus on independent media, and also more importantly, uplift the voices of the brave men and women in the medical profession who have spoken out against this medical tyranny.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> So that leads right into my first question, and I\'m gonna throw this out for response, raise your hand if you want to go and I\'ll acknowledge you. So Professor myon said that the I forget your exact words, but that our reality matrix is being is being created by the propaganda matrix, not by independent media. So if independent media is going to get back in the game, what is it we can do to better serve our audience and help them transform away from the situation and the tyranny that is threatening all of us?</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Anyone who wants to take that? Patrick?</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> I\'ll have a stab at that. You have to Katherine, that\'s a that\'s a really difficult question. You know, one of the big fundamental problems with the current situation, in terms of social media platforms dominating and hoovering up a large percentage of the online traffic is while the mainstream media why governments are seem to be, you know, seem to be rooting out this scourge of disinformation, as they call it, or misinformation, as YouTube, and Google often referred to it or Facebook, there is a lot of misinformation that is circulating even in alternative media, in on social media as well to just to add a little more complication to the mix. So within the independent media, there\'s that problem that people have to contend with as well. But I think people our viewers are more discerning than ever. And this this crisis has forced a lot of people in in many ways is raised</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> The standard of analysis, a recent MIT report where they sent undercover researchers into the quote, alternative media found that there\'s a higher standard of data integrity. And following the facts within the quote, skeptics community, as they, as they said, is opposed to what they would call the mainstream audiences. So that\'s definitely a positive development. So in many ways, people are being forced to be more discerning and to raise their game. So that to me is very promising. And it only means that things are going to open up more and more in the independence sphere and more quality content, hopefully is going to move into that, that space as well.</p>',
