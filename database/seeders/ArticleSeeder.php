          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">I thought Kirk Lazarus in tropic thunder was really a black guy. I didn’t know it was Robert Downey Jr. in black face, back when that was allowed. He [Robert Down Jr.] fooled me twice. He is a white actor playing an Australian character playing a black character. And I still thought for the longest of time, for years, that it was really a black guy. Now, if I can admit to that, can you admit and forgive yourself for some of things you thought you knew but didn’t? Because, to quote the great Lazarus: \'We\'re really fucking lost man!’.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In the middle of the movie, the unit of actors reach the dan cook river. “We’re lost man! We’re super fucking lost man!”, cries out Lazarus. They take the map away from their blissfully ignorant leader who have led them astray by miles and decide to turn around and go in the real direction towards their destination. I think we’ve reached the same point in the covid-19 planned pandemic. And we need to take the map from our government which has led us so far astray and get back to the destination which we were initially headed. A better society for humanity based on moral principles, rather than that of indebtedness and serfdom through a new world order and global banking system.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">When our government, realizes that too many people have woken up already, the tied is turning, and that they will be held accountable for the crimes the committed against humanity and frantically yells out in a desperate attempt to control us: ‘But we’re suppose to be a unit’. Remember the word of the year in 2021. ‘Samfundssind’. Showing community spirit. Well, once you wake up do like Kirk Lazarus and tell the government to: ‘Suck my unit’. In the utmost polite way possible. We’re still ladies and gentlemen of the court at their trial, remember.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">“You about to cross some fucking lines!”, replies Lazarus agitated when Alpa Chino (creator of booty juice) causes offense to the Australian people and culture. Don’t mess with the Australians. Oh shoot, I forgot, the actor is not really Australian. Is that cultural appropriation? I can’t wait until all of Australia, in unison, decide to mass meditate and channel their inner Crocodile Dundee. “Pump your breaks kid, that mans a national treasure”. Oh I know. I hope to see Australia, with the same spirit they fight off boxing kangaroos’ and wrestle with alligators, will come together and wrestle off their tyrannical government, building prison camps for the freedom loving people of Australia all over their beautiful (but spider infested) country. When you finally topple your tyrannical government (in as peaceful a manner as possible of course if any lawyer reads this) then rejoice by throwing some shrimps on your barby! Aussi Aussi Aussi! Let the rebuilding begin.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Native American tribes have cast a spell to protect tropic thunder from any scrutiny. Just like Reiner Fullmich and so many other freedom fighters enjoy protection from the spirits in the light realm. So you go ahead and see if you can break the protection spell and cancel this movie that is better than anything woke Hollywood could ever produce. Please, a female James bond? These are truly the end times. If there’s any humanities student from the university of Copenhagen who is appalled by my comparisons, I will just remind you that it was actually once allowed to make fun of our king and queen and our mommy in chief. Our economy breaking, family ruiner, mistress of misfortune not loving but only depressing. Our destroyer of once a nation, our national traitor (albeit if she’s found guilty in the courts) sitting at home, sipping her tea, reading her Shakespeare and pretending all is fine. Does she know the irony of reading Shakespeare? These are truly Shakespearean times. The life expectancy and birth rate is almost to match. Too harsh? Please don\'t punish me. I haven’t been indoctrinated enough, that’s all. I’m not suppose to question the matriarchy because we obviously live in a patriarchy, even though our prime minister is a women. Confused? Don’t be. You see, now you made her cry. Once the new world order is set in place, that will show me. I will be forced to recite feminist doctrines all day in a courtyard of fools. Walking to and fro in a contemplative state with people who thought we still had human liberties and fundamental rights. What in God’s name happened? Silly me. There’s even a guy who got his head cut off for trying to introduce free press into the kingdom of Denmark. He also slept with the queen which didn’t help. Huh, seems like that was important for some reason. But who needs that when you have state funded mainstream media constructing your reality matrix. Don’t eat that Neo! For goodness sake you may wake up and realize what’s going on around you. We can’t have that. Jesus, the predictive thought police, yes that’s actually real, are going to have a field day with me. So many wrong thoughts. Please don\'t give up on me, I can still conform. Mommy in chief are you still there? Don’t eat your liver pâté with rhubarb on rye bread when I’m talking to you. I can still change!</p><p class="serif lh-lg">If the universe decides, out of all the 1000 word articles I’ve written, that this is the one that will finally wake people up, then I will know the universe has a sense of humor. So please don\'t share this. I don’t want to be remembered for this kind of writing alone. Please universe, be dark and cruel and rid of any humor! I cannot bear being remembered as someone for wrote almost in shakespearian proses (maybe that’s pushing it) as the guy who did in depth analysis of the covid-19 crime against humanity by quoting Kirk Lazarus from tropic thunder. He even thought he was a black guy. Now, perhaps, it’s time for you to admit your mistakes and begin the process of reflection and of grief and reach a state of forgiveness. And rejoice. There’s always light and hope.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">I was for a brief stint, in 2020, getting psychiatric help. Gasp and horror that\'s why we don\'t have to listen to him! He certifiably loony. He even has the papers to prove it. Our ever so trustworthy WHO even says so. Whew what a relief, then we can go back to sleep. Let\'s continue reading and remember to roll your eyes every now and then. But please be careful your eyes don\'t roll out of your head (read back with danish sarcasm at it\'s finest).</p><p class="serif lh-lg">When the doors swung open into the psychiatric facility in Copenhagen, Denmark, I was filled with a bunch of stories about how professional and competent these people were, representing this fine institution. There reputation was flawless. Initially, the way it works is, you fill out a questionnaire, created by the WHO (not the danish government), in collaboration with a psychologist. Then they set up a round table of health professionals who will discuss what I answered on the survey. Notice how the human being, that would be me, is reduced to a questionnaire. Because why would they want to look me in the eyes? This is done so deliberately to loose all the nuances of a response with the written word and numerical scales. Are you suicidal and do you hear voices, takes on a whole other meaning when you see it represented in a survey, than when you actually take the time to talk to people. I do actually feel a little bit down today. Aha, then he’s clearly suicidal, you see it says so on the survey. At this point already red warning lights should be flashing, but let’s go on. I envisioned this round table having intense and heated debates about every last response from my survey. But I also know the reality of things. The people sitting around this table, more often than not, are picked for there job because they are agreeable people. But what you in reality want, is someone who could raise their hand in disagreement. You get the impression it’s hard to get a diagnosis, but in reality it’s very easy when everyone simply just agrees. Lunch time soon anyone? After all why do they care. It’s just another useless resource running through the system so big pharma can tell me to open wide, swallow their pills and become a perpetual customer. That it is good people hurting other good people only makes the devil laugh even harder as he has done in the past when we choose to make war with our brothers and sisters. I jokingly told a family member that they should do A/B testing on these questionaries from the WHO with healthy mental people thrown into the mix to establish a sound baseline. I think we would find that the WHO thinks everyone has a mental illness nowadays. They are the real ones in charge. Not just in psychiatry but also in the covid-19 pandemic.  They promised me they would have a sit down with my family to get a richer picture of me and my circumstances. They wouldn’t just base it on a questionnaire, heavens no. That was a flat out lie. That never happened. Probably because it would have contradicted the diagnosis I got handed straight down from the WHO. As a caveat, I later found out through a danish documentary, that once you have been given a certain diagnosis it cannot be removed from your medical journal ever again.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">It became apparent after a while that their motives were different from mine. I couldn’t see myself in the diagnosis nor could my loved ones. I have a whole closet full of medication, yet I never consented even once to get the medication. I find it fitting that the crest of the field of medicine is a snake because they hope you are so anxious and weak mentally that you’ll then take it when you’re hope.  Just try it, it will make all your pain go away. They pressed it into my hand and I threw it into my bag pack, but I never forgot, and I reminded that every chance I could, that I did not consent to get the medication. Does that make it clear for anyone reading this and seeing this from the outside about the screwed messed up state of psychiatry? I sure hope so. By all means make up your own mind if your thinking getting help from these people, but if you want my opinion then whatever you do steer clear away from it. If you general practitioner refers you to a psychiatric facility then he lives in willful ignorance of what’s going on inside the walls. Don’t be fooled by someone wearing a lab coat. Many people, my sister Hannah, included have been hurt intentionally by big Pharma and it’s time they pay for what they’ve done (through the court of law).</p><p class="serif lh-lg">I went browsing solo for a while in search for better label, I mean diagnosis and stumbled upon Aspergers Syndrome. But I closed the chapter for good, of trying to get help from this field, when I learned that it was a eugenics project. Nobody wants to be at autistic, one end of the spectrum, but everyone wants to be an aspee. I never could figure out why all the experts talking about Aspergers nearly all had Aspergers themselves. And only highly intelligent and people we look up to in society probably secretly was a part of the club. A flattering diagnosis but not for me.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">2020 provided a much needed breathing room for many people. 2021 provided us with a choice, an opportunity to show our true colors, you could no longer hide. 2022 as the year everything clicked into place and I found myself through spiritual enlightenment. It provided me with a framework, a difference in perspective, a prism in which life is no longer just a life, but a like pearls on a string. Everything that is alive cannot die. You have a soul and it weighs 22 grams (roughly). You have lived many lives, you chose to come down and experience earth, maybe even to help if you now the current situation we find ourselves in. The spiritual component in psychiatry was intentionally swept under the rug because it would have given you so much power and inner strength that you wouldn’t have needed a magic bullet (pill) to get better. Your body is a complex chemical factory. A marvel to behold. Something to appreciate. I see clearly now that the way in which our society is structured is not stable. I was struggling because my ego was whispering in my ear I was stupid and worthless because I couldn’t fit in and do what everyone else did. It would have been easy if people around me didn’t think I had something to offer. He will become a professor one day don’t you know. Why then, when I love life and feeling the creative energies, can I not climb the pyramid that is our societies hierarchy. As Nikolai Tesla told us, if you want to know the secrets of the universe then you must understand light, sound and frequency. Climbing the ranks in our society does not correlate with intelligence, what is that anyways if the brain is only a switchboard and your real “intelligence” lie anchored in your immortal soul? Rather, the ability of climbing the ranks of society is indication of how ignorant, willful or otherwise, you are to the nature of our reality. For the people in the streets fighting for our fundamentals liberties, the human transition that will take place in 2022 will be smooth sailing. For the people who have lived in the ignorance of not knowing, of thinking they are better than there fellow counterparts (because they’ve been told that all the way through their many years of school) it is a bumpy road to learn that what they thought they knew was a lie or at the very least misleading. I encourage anyone who is struggling in these difficult trying times, not to seek help from psychiatry, but rather go the spiritual path and find out just how much you have to offer the world. The notes below provide an excellent starting point if you ask me. You’re an immortal soul and you have lived many lives. On this planet and probably elsewhere. You’re bright, intelligent and capable human being. I wish you well on your journey to enlightenment. May God and your spirit guides watch over you and may you have many experiences in this duality, of positive and negative experiences, that is life. </p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">If your vaccinated, I’m so sorry. I harbor no ill will against you and I think, and pray, that there’s hope for a healthy recovery to the ones who took the vaccines. Please seek comfort, love and hope from friends and family in these difficult trying times. Now on to the ridiculousness that is our world governments desperately trying to raise the vaccine uptake because their global handlers were telling them to do so. They are not jokes, they actually happened. Check out the notes for yourself if you don’t believe me.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Free burgers. The former mayor of New York were enticing people with free burgers if they got vaccinated. Ask Michael Knowles from the Daily Wire commented so eloquently: "Come and get your slop you pigs”. It’s a good start, but we can do way better than that.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Free college. Again, the state of New York offered kids from the age 12-17 to enter into a raffle of winning free college but at the cost of their very lives. These vibrant and young energetic beings were lured with the promise and hope of a better future. It’s almost unbearable to imagine some kids willfully taking the offer not realizing they were lie to and now there health is potentially on the line. That is heartbreaking. Surely, that tops the list of the most dark ways young people have ever been lured into doing perhaps (but pray god hopefully not) irreversible damage to their health. After a brief moment of contemplation I think this tops the list for me. Because kids and I think teenagers stand no chance against providing informed consent. If there parents are informed properly then their children more than likely are not either. A promise of a better future in exchange for young and vibrant health. That is truly despicable.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Free Lap dance. The city of Las Vegas offered people free “special” services if people got vaccinated. In a strip club! I feel dirty even writing about this, but anything for a good laugh I guess.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Prostitution. It wasn\'t just the die hard capitalists who prostituted themselves to big pharma that needs to do some serious inward reflection and soul searching. The government of x allow a brothel to entice men to take the vaccine in order to get an appointment with a prostitute of their choice (no judgment passed). I imagine, God our creator, if this entity indeed is a man, to sit down these men, the sons of God, who took this offer willingly and tell them. Listen my son. Men are from mars, women are from venus, but nobody is that desparate to get some coitus with their penis (a master at work with his tool that is his words).  When I told people about it they didn’t believe me. I still don’t think they believe me. But look in the notes for yourself. Viewer discretion is advised, the picture in the article is the stuff of nightmares. You’ve been forewarned.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">These events are actually going to be written into some chapter in a history book. Remember the conspiracy to commit crimes against humanity that was the covid-19 planned pandemic? The audience of students will all nod in agreement, they definitely remember, it’s one of the biggest crimes against humanity to have ever taken place. Then some professor or teacher will tell them about the many absurd ways in which governments, like the poisoned apple in Snow White and the seven dwarfs, tried to trick people into getting a “vaccine” that was potentially lethal and getting people to play russian roulette with their lives and the lives of their children. The students would creep forward in the seat. People would shrug their heads. No they had never heard about those tricks. What were they? Well some governments actually went as low as trying to get people, men mostly, to take the “vaccine” through prostitution. Gasps will fill the crowded auditorium. No they definitely didn’t believe that. No way. Confidently the professor strutted over to his computer and flipped to the next slide. Then the auditorium went silent. People didn’t know what to think or feel. Throughout the whole pandemic everyone had been so manipulated and lied to that there moral compasses couldn’t guide them anymore in telling them what was up and what was down. But everyone in the room knew that this wasn’t all negative. This event in human history was a transition for humanity into a better existence, but for that to happen humanity had to learn from this very experience, each and every single one of their ancestors, for things to get better for humanity and for humanity to loose their slave masters which had kept them in chains.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Also, I have a bone to pick with my fellow danes. Why in Gods name didn’t we leave something for our future generation to have a laugh about. Why didn’t we disagree with the government in order to see how far they would go in order to get us “vaccinated”? I must say, I think we lost a golden opportunity there. I, for one, would have love to see our mommy in chief, our premier, offer us free prostitutes in order to get vaccinated. Imagine having that as part of our proud history. Shame on us for not uniting and making that our priority. Now, if you haven’t noticed, mommy premier is upset, no more nice mommy minister, so I don’t think will get that chance ever again in history. But predicting the future at this point would be equally ridiculous, so who knows. For anyone not danish who reads this, the mainstream media tried to win favor with the premier at the start of the pandemic by calling her mommy Mette. That is not a joke either, look in the notes if you need a good laugh. We all need a good laugh that raises our spirits and thereby our hope and chance of getting of the mess we currently find ourselves in.</p>',

Because you’ve been dipped in fear and your psychological health has been broken deliberately by the perpetrators behind this whole pandemic. They have tried to instill, through the very powerful mainstream media, that everything is hopeless and all is lost. But I’m hear to tell you it’s not. We’ve already won, now it is time to clean up the mess they made and rebuild with human value and dignity at it’s best, meaning no violence or destructive forces. Then we would have lost. Only love, peace and positive high frequencies can make the darkness surrounding europe once again go away. This may very well be your final wake up call. Put on your fitting spirit and help yourself and everyone you love and care about stand against tyranny. To think that you have no voice is to render yourself unable to enact the last final push for human liberation. Peaceful disobedience is also a great first step. Say no. Feel the power of not wearing a mask when your told because you stand in your truth, you’ve investigated the matter and in turns out it’s all just for show. There’s no scientific evidence. A great starter if you ask me, because they want us to wear the mask for symbolic reasons of showing obedience, that your willing to accept what you’re told even when you know it’s wrong. If you feel your spirit is badly bruised I can understand. But you’re so much more than a dissenter. You’re an intelligent, wonderful and loving human being with all the power in the world to turn this around. Join the peaceful protests around europe. Help extinguish the negative destructive energy with your light and positivity. It is never to late to stand in your truth. The first steps are always the hardest, but what will greet you if you do are loving and welcoming human beings for you to walk along side with as equals. This is truly history in the making and something to excitedly tell your grandchildren about one day once we have cleaned up europe and liberated our cities.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">We’re not going back to the good old bad old days. What awaits us you and I get to decide if we so choose. In the notes you’ll find some footage of countries around europe protesting. The people realize that freedom is not a noun but a verb. Something never finished, never done. Something you must constantly take, something you must constantly become. If you’re still confused and left wondering what is going on in the world, then I encourage you, to once and for all, take responsibility of living your truth. Do not remain in the ignorance of not knowing why people are protesting, but the bliss is only temporary and life has given you a grand opportunity to step up to the plate (to use an american expression) and show the world your true colors. I’m one sentence away from going communist and calling you comrade but I won’t because I’m not a communist (nothing wrong with that of course). I stand against violence, so this is not an incident to do so. This is an attempt at a love declaration for the europe that has seen so many wars, pain and suffering to make you wake up at last and rather than using your passions for darkness, join the light and help use rebuild our society. Brick by brick, life by life.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Recently the president of France, one of the Rothschilds prodegies, and place on the throne as a strategic chess piece for the central banks and the 13 or so families running the world, recently showed his true self.

This is the strategy.”</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The big bad boogie monster macron and the other pawns of the european governments will go away and loose power as soon as you turn off the mainstream media and listen in on where the actual conversations are taking place. I only make light hearted fun of the people in power who thought selling their soul and committing crimes against their fellow man would ever amount to anything remotely resembling a positive force for good. Maybe they should have embraced a cold shower of contemplation in the morning before venturing down this road leaving nowhere. When you choose to stand up and join and embrace your fellow man, and women, in the streets your fear and negative low frequencies will disappear and you will once again be in harmony and balance and feel love and excitement for how we are going to rebuild our societies. To piss Macron off specifically I will end this call to civil disobedience and peaceful protests by borrowing a phrase from the French revolutionists who fought for the fundamental freedoms and liberties that we enjoyed until yesterday: Vive la France! Vive l’Europe! I’m mean, the last people on earth to piss off if you look in the history books is the French. Sure, we europeans make fun of the French they eat snails, they make funny cars, they talk in weird accents oui oui, but at the end of the day we all know that deeply imbedded in the DNA of every man and women in France is the historical ancestral lessons of the French Revolution. We freedom loving people of europe stand with france stand with all our fellow europeans and the rest of the world in once and for all riding this darkness from the face of the planet earth. Your time, yes you reading this, is now. Feel the energy and power that held all this time but was suppressed! Now use the for a positive good!</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">The battle of Los Angeles, also referred to as the great Los Angeles air raid, happened at a time when the US was dragged into WW2 following the attack on pearl harbor in 1941. The US military were on edge for the next (possible) imminent attack on the US mainland. Around 3 am sirens around the Los Angeles counties starting blaring and shortly after gunfire started to fire sporadically. Los Angeles, as seen through the eyes of the US military, was under attack. The sleepy residents of the city of Angeles concerned enough by the sirens and the gunfire would go out into the street. Numerous (eye witness accounts) people said they saw experienced a huge oval object in the sky. Film footage was recorded, along with pictures, in the newspaper following the next morning. Something was definitely there as confirmed by the sightings and the US military. I will argue it wasn’t a balloon, based in part, on the testimony of William Tompkins who was there that day and what he experienced.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">First and foremost, it is naive to believe we’re alone in the universe. We only have to look at the truly breathtaking numbers. There are billions of planets in the universe and billions of solar systems. Astrological findings would validate/agree, that the possibility of finding life (in whatever shape that may take) is significantly high.  //To suppose we’re alone in the universe is naive. William Tompkins was just a kid, when the Los Angeles sighting took place. He lived down by the Santa Monica pier. On the day of the event, he and another person went out on the balcony at night and saw a beam of light which peaked their curiosity. Then that beamed of light approached where they stood and flashed a light in their direction which illuminated everthing around them. Then, in a instance, the light disappeared. They didn’t think any further of the situation and proceeded to have dinner, listen to the radio and go the bed. The were woken by the sound of anti aircraft artillery which made them jump out of bed and into the streets like many other Angelenos and his witness testimony account deflates (no pun intended) the argument that the sighting could be explained away by being a balloon. How else could you explain the floating behavior of the craft?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The US navy also managed to shoot down two different smaller vessels not operated by any being inside supposedly. One shot down into the sea and retrieved. This sparked the beginning of the secret space program at Douglas. Also, right after this event took place was when W. Tompkins was contacted by the races that go by the name: Nordics.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">W. Tompkins was responsible for the redesign of the Apollo space program and was a key figure in getting people to the moon. He believed the reason for this sighting could have been to establish contact with other human beings in which he and others believe there are 1000s if not hundred of thousand. And Tompkins is by no means alone. In our neighboring country of Sweden a woman named Susan Bjorklund is in contact with a race of beings which go by the name: The Pleadians. And so many others.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The Los Angeles sighting challenges our belief systems. One the one hand, the people that saw the event up close clearly know it wasn’t a balloon. The argument falls to the floor quickly when you pierce the shallow headlines from the newspapers and radio at the time. In the beginning I found myself, when I began just recently digging into the larger question of whether we’re alone in the universe, to fallback to the mainstream media to help me uncover how my reality looks like. And even they and the US military would agree as early as 2017 that we have unidentified flying objects (UFO’s) which help support the case that we humans both Nazi fractions and the US military have had access to anti gravity vehicles since at least 1942. I hope this will help start a cascade effect in the minds of people out there reading this, that we’ve been told a lot of lies, perhaps even going as far back as six thousand years. And when you muster the courage to look into this yourself without first weighing the social repurcsion of thinking there is something to this, then you’ll find we’re not alone in the universe. We have access to incredible technology (but at present time only for the few not for the many) and that races from other planets are already in contact and helping us humans. Don’t believe everything hollywood has told you. Races from off planet are not only regressive and negative but also supportive and positive. Which is why nobody was afraid when the sighting took place and tragically the only people that died that day was people who were hit by the artillery shrapnel. If you open your mind, you’ll find amazing and wonderful events awaits us. You only have to look up at the night sky on a clear night.</p><h5 class="fw-bold fst-italic serif">Notes</h5><p class="serif lh-lg">[1] "William Tompkins: Selected By Extraterrestrials - Part One" Bitchute, uploaded by ProjectCamelot, 21 Nov. 2016, https://www.bitchute.com/video/JwZZ9dQLdI1M/ (47:40)</p><i class="serif lh-lg">I encourage you to assume responsibility for your own sense making and reality.

But you must learn how to crawl before you can walk, I hear a pedagogue say. Exactly, so why don’t we take these children by the hand help them utilize their untapped potential of wonder and fantasy and show them how to shape their ideas into reality. We can always teach them grammar. But motivation is key, especially when you’re young. Oh how exciting, I get a grade with a marker on it and a paper back with lots of red scribbles and question marks on it for me to edit and contemplate. I’m sorry, but this kills any creative imagination in a kid. In anyone for that matter. Let’s go to the marketplace of ideas. It’s like a bazaar where everyone is excitedly sharing from their hearts of hearts all the glorious and wonderful ideas they have. No idea is to wacky. Have you ever read Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll? Or an H.C Andersen adventure if your danish (no not the pastry)?</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What does great writing look like? I’m glad you ask. Because one of the ways in which you become a great writer is to read a lot of books. You see how that works? Do you see how human beings help each other grow and evolve into becoming better and better versions of themselves. Let me unlock for you what has been deliberately kept from you. All the great writers through history. The greatest motivation you could ever need. You find a starting list in the notes below.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What do you think of when you think of a book? What kind of writing would deserve to bound in a book for people to pick of a shelf at a library and read? I better take extra care that my idea is compelling. That I get to the point and clear away any padding, any filling, that is unnecessary and does convey my point properly. The symbolism is strong and will stay with the children forever. Do you really think my thoughts and ideas are worth being wrapped up in book? Yes. I do. They learn to listen to their soul. They seek inward in moments of much needed contemplation with themselves. No, I’m not quiet satisfied with this argument here. I need to strengthen this point and convey its purpose more clearly. This paragraph feels out of place. The sentences do not quiet flow smoothly. I think this line needs to be rewritten with a better more clear word in mind that expresses what I think.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Motivation is often a factor when dealing with kids who needs to learn how to write and through that process learn how to think critically. I admit, looking back in my days at school, I had trouble getting motivated when I needed to write about a topic. Do you think Shakespeare would have been sufficiently motivated in modern day compulsory schooling, or do you it was something else was needed for him? Do your think H.C Andersen was motivated in school to become a great writer and thinker when he was forced, like many generations were, to learn and recite latin phrases? But you must learn to crawl before you can walk. Leave H.C Andersen alone, let him and help him unleash his creative imagination and you get some of their greatest children’s stories ever written. People come from afar to experience Denmark, to get a taste of the country where he was from. Still remembered and read to this day. They are so much more than children stories as we all know. The emperors wears no close has been adopted by many people around the world and used as a way to communicate when a group of people think one thing, when a single person sees everything for what it is. A naked emperors. Books is a proud part of the history of humanity. It is a symbol of collaboration when you write something of importance (to you and perhaps others) which can help people in the generations to come. What better motivation is their to become a great writer and thinker. When you segregate writing from it’s historical context as to why people wrote and were conveying ideas through this mechanism in the first place, then you compartmentalize children into a strict regime of writing papers in order to get a grade in return for your obedience to the task at hand. Great writers throughout history, if they were to have gotten a grade for their work, would probably all have gotten an F (-3 in Denmark). Because the greatest authors throughout history were often conveying very controversial ideas in his time, not fully appreciated by the masses and the people in charge of control. This happens usually after some years or decades or even a century has passed. Obvisouly the reason why you don’t want kids to learn how to write and to become great thinkers, is that it becomes a lot harder to control and manage obedience and compliance when you have trained children into becoming critical thinkers who can see through the managerial powers holding them in place in their designated layer in society. If this is shocking to you, that it the true purpose of schooling, then I would suggest becoming squinted with a school teacher for 30 years in New York City, a gentlemen known as John Taylor Gatto. The purpose of schooling is dumbing down, arguably, in order to make it easier to manage people, ie. Resources for the managers higher up in the pyramid structure. That is accomplished through what he [John Taylor Gatto] calls weapons of mass instruction. It is my belief that every single kid in a crowded classroom, has every single opportunity to become the next great author of our time. Genius really is as common as dust. But very few get to reach their full potential (their genius level capabilities) because it makes the whole societal structure shake to it’s very core if you truly educated kids into becoming independent and capable thinkers. Those people cannot be managed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Schools in the United States, and arguably in the west as a whole, is in dire need of a reform, and this is but one suggestion as to how we can make every kid in a classroom grow up with much needed capable leadership skills. I, for one, would much rather have a society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential as truly equal men and women under God, rather than having what we arguably currently have, people, myself included, who been under instrumentation, that is schooling, that has dumbed us down and kept us in extended childhood, never been allowed to grow up. But this, as well as the rest of our societies in need of reform, will very soon change. And if you have kids you will hopefully see the grow up and become wickedly smart and capable human beings in a new system of education, rather than forced compulsory schooling. Because, though the powers at be, would like to equate school with education, they are separate. And an education is what you can give yourself, each and every one of us, when we assume responsibility for our own understanding of the universe. What may I hope? What ought I do? What is man?</p>',

The present events unfolding, seemingly at rapid speed. Government officials breaking human rights violations, in particular the UNESCO agreement made after the WW2 atrocities and the Nuremberg (1.0) trials. The future is worth being excited about when we take a closer look at what we have to look forward to in the not so distant future, once we have weathered the storm, stronger and more united than ever. Weaving a tapestry of past, present and future, from perviously unseen angles, will allow us to catch a glimpse of what the human race will transition into. If we wake up and adopt self responsibility that is. Otherwise a group of other folks will gladly lead us into the most tyrannical totalitarian system the world has ever seen. Reason enough to wake up, I suppose. If not for you then the next generation to follow.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">For some people, having their world being turned upside down is rather unpleasant. But I thought our government had our best interests at heart, first and foremost our health and well being. It’s uncomfortable to learn that they are just towing the line for the real small fraction of people in charge of this whole planned operation that is covid-19. But before jumping into that, I would like you to join me on a journey back in time, to ancient Egypt. In a time where pharos reigned, sometimes with cruelty, over the jewish people.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The “Custodians” of the homo sapiens, that would be us, is a term borrowed by William Bramley in his book: Gods of Eden. We, as a collective, haven’t really had time to go into details about the many findings of our past and what they mean for the current understanding of our races. The intelligent design hypothesis along with archeological findings including the Cambrian explosion and the invention and adoption of DNA would seriously question that previously unquestionable in evolutionary biology, Darwins theory of Evolution. There is no evidence of evolutionary progression from ape to man (homo sapien). Another idea, namely the intelligent design hypothesis takes hold when we factor in DNA as the source code the creator(s). It seems very likely when reading biblical texts like Genesis and others carefully, that the human race was a slave race and our so called custodians where as a matter of fact a malevolent race from another world. They saw human beings as a resource to be exploited, a little like we saw horses in the nineteenth century as a means of getting around the country. It’s a long way to fall from the epistles at the universities who have taught and who think we are all alone in the universe, that it couldn’t be further from the truth. Both malevolent as well as benevolent beings from other worlds exist. Human beings have been kept in chains. Only the kings and queens, the pharos and popes of our time, as well as the occult secret societies have been allowed to communicate and thereby know the true history of humanity. Therein lies the story once told that the king held the connection to god. The custodians are not gods, but you can see why our ancestors thought so. Technically advanced beings flying around in described cigar shaped and spherical balls of light. Descriptions since ancient times of flying boats and these exact shaped flying objects. </p><p class="serif lh-lg">Putting our current world events into perspective you would see that what were going through is a seismic paradigm shift. Humanity is loosing it’s chains. We’re becoming aware of who we are. There are apparent good news to report and get excited about. Our “custodians” are gone. They have been defeated by beings of the light. I will leave it to prominent figures to explain the exact details of the story, I will just skim for the sake of brevity. Though our other worldly “custodians” are gone, we still have human beings at the top of our pyramid structured society sitting with the schematics as to how to enslave humanity once again, more brutal than ever. So, this is where I believe we find ourselves. As with covid-19 and so many other things, including our very own history, we’ve been lied to. We need to come to terms that we’ve been a slave race for many years. We need to come to terms with what that means as to our self understanding and our place in the universe, because that is not centric in nature, but actually more like way out in the desert where only dustballs roll about taken by the wind from time to time. I’m of course talking about our place in our solar system. Down town should apparently be very busy, are we ready for that? I think we are. The alliances of benevolent other world races who have helped us apparently has a very clear message. They helped us and defeated and liberated us from our custodians. You’re welcome. Now it’s time that we rise up in unisons and loose our human captors. I believe we can do it and are doing it as we speak.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The Nuremberg 2.0 trials (we must find a better name, I’m sure we can come up with something) are set to begin very soon. Spearheaded by Reiner Fullmeich, a list of competent human beings, including Michael Yeadon have amassed and collected enough evidence to put the criminals behind the crimes against humanity we call the covid-19 planned pandemic and the vaccines and restrictions on human freedom away for ever. Too many people have woken up already. Look at Austria, Australia, Germany, not to mention Denmark, though we’re a small country of course, we have a loud voice and an important role to play still. When we defeat our human captors who are trying to keep us enslaved, then we will rejoin with the rest of the universe, we will get to know our true history in full technicolor. We will slowly rebuild our society with human dignity and values placed in the very heart, the very center of all decisions. No more outside intervention from other malevolent beings and no more collusion behind our back from our own race for their own selfish gains. We have so much to look forward to. So if you need a reason to wake up and join in the (peaceful) fight for our freedom back, then I can’t think of anything more encouraging than that.</p>',

Can you hear how it rhymes with the lessons of the past? I would tell you in reply, with all the love in my heart, who has the time to repeat these God awful lessons? By adopting responsibility now for your own sense making you’ll actually gain free time in the long run (emphasis on free, not living live in various mastering forms of slavery). This experience will keep being presented to humanity until we learn, each and every single once of us, what it means to take responsibility for our own lives. Not live by what socialist planners are telling us but rather live life as free men and women. Free to make choices over our own body (think that is called bodily autonomy if I may be so cheeky). Free to spend your money and thereby your free time on whatever you want. Free to travel, free to speak your mind (which clears up the fog in your mind and makes you able to think clearly), free to not live life by what controllers and socialist planners are telling you what to do, but by what you want to do. Like an atom is the building block of the universe, so an individual is the building block of society, the fundamentals way of which to organize society. Not the collective. It has never worked in the past and will never work in the future.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The end (all that is living must take the vaccine and the boosters in the future with no end in sight) justifies the means (the coercive, and illegal, measures applied to people who will not comply and refuse to get vaccinated). When the end justifies the means, putting a lockdown in place on an entire country, even though there are evidence that this will have the opposite effect of health and safety, becomes justified. When the end justifies the means, people loosing their jobs and committing suicide, becomes justified. When the end justifies the means censoring dissenting voices of doctors, scientists and people from all walks of life with a different perspective, becomes justified. When the end justifies the means is an extremely dangerous when power is concentrated in the hands of central planners. Do you get it yet? How many more examples of this do we have to go through in the future. When the end justifies the means, preventing the “unvaccinated” (whatever that means to the planners) from living in society (period) becomes justified. Have we really come to this? Do you really think your safe because you’ve done what the planners (ie. Your government) has told you what to do? There is no safety in collectivism, it is but a fleeting moment, when you have no individual human being with morals to scruple. No one in sight and no one to comfort you when the planners realize they made a mistake and are not willing to go any further with the methods they threaten to employ to reach the end. An end is insight but it is not the “vaccines”. Because they are not “vaccines” (if I have left the vaccine word bare without quotations in an article, please let me know). A vaccine is suppose to protect you from a virus. These do not do that and even the planners are telling us this at this point. They are a mechanism for something else. And you deserve to know what you put into your body. You’re a sovereign individual who made a mistake. We all do. But it is important that we learn this one especially. The people at the top tow the line and individuals with morals who would disagree, ask questions and offer different perspectives, have long left. If you don’t comply to the collective then you’re put in opposition and called a slew of words we’re all readily familiar with at this point (I don’t even have to write them up, they are seethed into our minds).</p><p class="serif lh-lg">A scary moment of realization is when you look around and see that everyone has been delegated to very specific sets of tasks (in true Prussian schooling style) and some are blindly following orders. A doctor or nurse who think they are not responsible for the crime the are committing. It’s the collective, the faceless institutions that bare responsibility. But when the truth comes out, who is to blame, who is responsible will be passed around amongst the people who committed these very crimes. People reducing themselves to just following orders are extremely dangerous because they lack a moral philosophy in life. Where did the hippocratic oath go. If you’re squeamish, look away now, do not read the next sentences in my attempt to make this lesson painfully clear. When the German soldiers marched to the middle of the forest and stood on the crest of a crater with a loaded gun and decided to shoot innocent children and babies with women screaming frantically trying to shield them from the hail of bullets ripping through their bodies in the fraction of an instant, just following orders wasn’t an excuse. How could the soldiers shoot innocent children? How can you inoculate a child with something that will almost certainly destroy his health (maybe even kill him, God forbid)? When doctors and nurses who inoculated men, women and children with these vaccines are just doing their job, some of them knew but some didn’t know what they had done, that is no excuse either. How dare I make such a horrid comparison! If invite you to see the following interview with Vera Sharev. This article isn\'t going anywhere. That is the lesson humanity is going through once again. The adoption of responsibility for ones action. Every single one of them. Do you hear the church bells tolling away in the distance because the death rate around the world has risen by 40% above normal (10% is considered a catastrophe)? Then see it as a sign for you to wake up. How do you want to be remembered? A silent desk killer? Someone who simply took marching orders? Are you taking full responsibility for your actions you doctors and nurses of Denmark? How will we ever trust you ever again? Do you know what’s in the vaccines? Are you an active member of the discussion of health and safety concerns of the vaccines? Have you ever seen one of these vaccines under a microscope? How come I probably, as many other lay people do, know more about these vaccines than you do? Could it be by design? I even attended a three day weekend conference in a frantic attempt to help my mom and my little sister who took the vaccines in the good faith that they were safe and effective. This is not a threat (period), but whoever inoculated these two people in my life with an experimental “vaccine”, will be held accountable. I will make it my life mission if I have to, to make it painstakingly obvious to you that just following orders is not an excuse. I hope by now this message has been seared into your brain, just like mainstream media tried to sear into our brain to be good and obedient citizens and take the vaccines to get back to normal. Look around you, we’re no where near going back to normal, not ever. Throughout history once government has taken and put restrictions on your life they have never willingly given them back again. My message of hope to all (especially the people who got the “vaccines”) is that one of the biggest trials in the history of humanity is set to begin. The crimes committed against you, and every single one of us, will be exposed and facts will be put out in the open for everyone to see. This too shall pass and we will rebuild once we rid this darkness from planet earth. But first you must ask yourself. What enabled Hitler and others like him to get to power? How about Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini or Mao? Why is it the worst get on top? Why not someone like you and me, for the good of humanity? Time for you to roll up your sleeve and figure that one out for yourself. Luckily, our history is filled with examples for you to go explore.</p>',

Do not allow beau tracts to tell you whether you’re allowed to hug the people in your life you care about. Feel the power of a hug.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to masks. Masks are used as a symbol, above all else including health and safety, to indicate obedience, and compliance, to the controllers. Masks do not protect you nor anyone else from catching covid-19. It’s an anti-life agenda, designed to dehumanize you. A face is no longer an interface used for conversing when you can’t see the human being behind the mask. It prevents you from getting oxygen to your brain, so masks actually damage your health. You inhale oxygen and exhale carbon-dioxide (CO2), but when you wear a mask the latter cannot escape so you actually inhale back into your lungs what you were suppose to exhale. Which can, and almost certainly will, cause damage to your lungs and thereby your health. It is a test to see how scared, and for the matter our society is. How many are wearing a mask? How many actually now that it is a symbol? Why wear something for symbolic reason. Would you know that the pandemic was still going on if people weren’t wearing masks when you go out shopping for groceries for instance. Masks damage your health. It is written into our (danish) legislation that if you feel any sort of discomfort you can take it off. The controllers hope, of course, that you are to afraid to do so, because of the social pleasure applied to conforming to ever changing sets of, in my opinion, absurd doctrines. The first time is always frightening. Do your own research on masks first, know the rights you have in your country and then take it off the next time you go out shopping for instance. Then you become a powerful symbol of hope and human freedoms to other who may be on the fence of stepping into their true self.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to PCR-Testing. The CDC (center of disease control) in the United States just recently went out and said that the PCR-Test cannot distinguish between the common flu and covid-19. Nations, including Denmark, have spend so much money on our PCR-Testing equipment. And it doesn’t work. The inventor of the PCR-Test as late as 2019 went out and said it can only be used in a research laboratory setting, with a low risk of bacterial contamination. I’m sorry to inform you, but the swaps that they’ve put in our noses and into the back of our throws is dipped in a radioactive chemical substance known to cause cancer. Do not take anymore PCR-Tests. Do not comply. Demand from your government that they show up to the table for a sound discussion on the scientific evidence which would suggest that the PCR-Tests work. CDC just swept the entire basis for locking down our country from under our feet. If the PCR test is not valid then we have no basis for locking down entire countries. Everything we went through the last two years. The numbers they showed us in the mainstream media. Pouring our entire economy down the drain. It was all based on the PCR-Test.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no lockdowns. The PCR-Test was the flawed data that was used to shut down entire nations and economies (read above paragraph about the PCR-Test). All the way back in march 2020, scientist and doctors went out and warned against shutting down entire countries. That it would, as a matter of fact, have the opposite effect. Which it did. Many people have committed suicide. Economies are tanking, despite our prime minister stating in her New Years address to the nation that it’s stronger than ever. Do not comply with a lockdown from these corrupt government and politicians of your country. Read up on the Great Barrington declaration if you want an answer as to why lockdowns have to opposite effect. They’ve never been put in place until the covid-19 pandemic. The intended goal from the controllers was to isolate you which would have the effect of making you anxious and scared of the invisible weapon (to the naked eye) that is the covid-19 virus. This would . This is the mass formation (psychosis) tactic employed almost in sync throughout the world. You would do anything, including taking an experimental “vaccine”, to make the pain go away and get back to normal. We’re not going back to normal. We will rebuild and rid this darkness from the planet earth and it’s start by you saying no. Join in demonstrations against lockdown. Demand more from your government. They are just people like you and me, remember.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to health pass. There is no health reason what so ever to introduce a health pass. There is no reasons what so ever to connect your health pass to your bank account. But it is quiet telling what world the controllers are pulling you in once you realize that it wasn’t about your health but always about control (go figure) of you and your assets and one way to do that is through the health pass. In their dystopian world, in order to access your money, you need to be up to date on your boosters. Did you have an adverse reaction? Too bad. It says in your health pass you’re unvaccinated (shame on you) because you’ve only had 5 boosters and not 6. Do you miss the good old bad old days when you thought you had bodily autonomy. When you thought you could still be a part of society? How does it feel to have no control over your body anymore? Do not comply with the health pass. If not for you then for your kids. Leave them a world were they still have control over their own bodies and financial assets. If this gets introduced (they are working diligently on it as we speak) it is the end of human liberty and freedom as we know it. Demand your rights back. Demand the people in your government who stripped you of these rights to be held accountable in the trials to come.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to “vaccines”. They are not “vaccines”. They do not protect you against covid-19. They are a part of a much bigger plan (see health pass paragraph above). Do not be tricked and manipulated by them anymore. Do not live in fear, embrace love and hope. Together we will turn this around and bring about a brighter future and it starts with you. Stand up and demand to know what is in the vaccines from your government and health officials. Do not give this to your kids. Become a mommy bear and papa bear who will protect them at all cost.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">Say no to restrictions. Do not let them take away your rights. Think about what kind of a planet we’re leaving for the next generation, seriously. When you finally stand up to your bully, you’d feel a lot better. Each time we comply to their restrictions on life, the people behind this planned pandemic are laughing at us. You’re so much more than what the planners and controllers think of you. They are afraid of you. They are afraid that you will get of your knees and embrace your fellow man in the street in the demand for justice and a trial for the atrocities committed. I do believe they events will become more and more absurd and that is a part of the final awakening of humanity. See what is happening around you as an opportunity every single day to step into your true self and stand tall. You and I have all the power in the world to turn this around. And it starts by saying no.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start">I’m trying to embrace the idea of a line of finite length with two opposing arrows from opposite sides, the vaccinated and unvaccinated  with a center point in the middle representing unity. I’m confident that the unvaccinated are already very close if not already at the center point. They know what’s at stake. The vaccinated, however, are a different story. Some are all the way at the start of the line, in complete polarity and opposition. The arrow hasn’t moved an inch. The vaccinated have to meet the unvaccinated half way. You have to willingly want to understand what’s going on. You have to willingly want to unite with the people who chose not to be vaccinated. I didn’t take the vaccine. You may think, why should I care about the ones that did? Why not just let them learn by experience what awaits them when the time is ready? Because this is one of the biggest crime against humanity and they deserve to know the injustice and the crime committed against them and perhaps even their children. That is enough reason for me to try, like so many others, to see how we can unite and meet at the middle.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">What awaits us if we unite is a future worth living in. One where men and women are free. If we are unable to be as one, we will become enslaved in the most tyrannical and dark new world order global banking system that will make you wish and regret that you didn’t do more when the time was right. In the notes you’ll find some, I believe, compelling evidence which suggest our world leaders are pulling us in this direction. The time to act is now, and it is not too late to pull up a chair and join the discussions about how we can combat this attack on human liberties and fundamental rights.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">When our compass at sea is going bezerk and the arrow is pointing both north and south seemingly all at once, it’s important to ground ourself in some basic human rights, before proceeding steering the ships that is our world governments.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The people behind this crime, would arguably say that the people who took the vaccines don’t deserve to live because they are useless. People have free will. No one was physically forced. They did it to themselves. I think in their screwed up human morals they believe that it justifies their claim that there are too many people on earth who are just blinding following orders and don’t think and therefor don’t deserve to live. If you think this is a sickening way to look at your fellow man, I would agree. But unfortunately these are some of the people at the top, steering the ship, and giving our governments read made talking points, instructing what to say and when to say it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">I think the people who got the vaccine and now regret it because they see through the lie that we were going back to normal, and as our danish government told us, it was a super weapon, need a confidence booster. Do not blindly follow orders from these people. Instead look to your fellow man in the exact same position as you whether you believe it or not. It is the end of the road, final call, for living life as a free man, if these new measurements are put in place. When the trap shuts with a loud snap and you look around and you find yourself in a world where your body is connected a global banking system, the government controls where you can go and when, then it will be too late to do anything. I’m sorry but that’s the hard truth.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">The reason why the people behind the curtain orchestrating this has been able to get away with stripping us from our basic rights, is because they do it incrementally in the hope you won’t see what they are up to. If you have a cat, have you ever seen it chase after a bird that landed on the ground. Immense focus and concentration on the target and small incremental steps towards your goal until you get so close that you’re ready to pounce. Will just remind people that the light always wins over the darkness. The bird saw the cat and flapped merely away. We are winning this psychological war that is roaring in the minds of people. You give them just one small bite and they’ll take your entire hand.  The storm will be over a lot quicker when we get together and unite.</p><p class="serif lh-lg">In Denmark, our government even went out and said that they had failed and so did a mainstream media organization. When do we realize that this is the signal for you to switch off the mainstream media and join in discussion with your fellow man. We all have the same interest. None of us wish to be torn apart, as a people and as a nation, but it’s a very old war tactic employed through the mainstream media. Divide and conquer your enemy has worked wonders ever since Machiavelli and the Roman Empire. What you have to ask yourself is this. Why do I feel divided? Where does that believe come from? And most importantly, if your feeling is of mutual agreement that we should approach unity and become one once again, how do we combat it? What does it take for you, for instance, to be willing to pull up and have a conversation, or hear an in-depth conversation, with an unvaccinated or a doctor or scientist who holds a difference of opinion not allowed on the mainstream media? The question of credibility comes up again and again in the mainstream media. Are you getting your information from a question from a credible source, is a slab in the face to the people who trusted the expert and government officials who told them to take a “vaccine” that was cloaked as an experimental gene based therapy. The good news is the people who told them to take the vaccine lied, which is not allowed under the laws of the universe, universal law. So anyone who took the “vaccine” had no way of providing informed consent regardless of what they will claim, in a desperate attempt to evade the crimes they committed against you.</p>',

          'article_body' => '<p class="serif lh-lg start"> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second day for doctors for COVID ethics gold standard symposium. We\'re going to start off this morning talking about something that came up a lot when we were covering both health and economics yesterday. And that is the propaganda matrix. And I\'m delighted to be joined by a wonderful group of journalists and publishers, people, and one academic people who know journalism and know communications. So let me just introduce you to our four panelists. First, we have and I have to thank him, Brian, I have to thank you for UK columns role in putting on this gold standard symposium. We have Brian garish, who after a successful career in the Royal Navy, Navy decided to do something about what was going on in the world. And the next thing he did was he discovered himself as a publisher in the media business.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And then we have Taylor hudak, who joined us last night as a moderator. Today, she\'s with us as a panelist, and she is one of those up and coming young journalists who\'s really doing amazing things on several websites, one in Munich, and then the American arts, the last vagabond, I believe, and, and Taylor has served doing communications for the doctors of COVID ethics, and so has a very unique perspective. We\'re also joined by Professor Michael Meyer, from the mind from the University of Munich. He says he\'s from academia. But I also know he has a little bit of journalistic experience in his background, but he\'s going to bring a more, I would say, a higher minded perspective, the rest of us are in the trenches. And then we have Patrick henningsen, from 21, at 21st century wire, who also does a show with UK column news and has a long and very distinguished career covering international politics, geopolitics, and I think has a very good sort of overview of the whole situation anyway. So ladies and gentlemen, welcome.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> I\'m going to start off by asking each of you to make a three and a half minute statement. And then we\'re going to have a bit of a response in a discussion. And, Brian, again, special thanks to you for your role in making this symposium possible. So let\'s start off with you. Well, thank you, thank you very much for inviting me and giving me this opportunity to speak were shorter time. So I\'m going to go very quickly. But I\'m going to say that for the last 10 years in particular, we\'ve been looking at something we think very dangerous unfolding in UK and that\'s the use of applied behavioral psychology in order to get political agendas through. This has now culminated in in the fact that we\'ve we\'ve had all of the chaos surrounding the COVID-19 policy in the lockdown and the resulting so called vaccination policy, that\'s all been happening. But we\'ve kept our eye very much on what\'s been happening with applied behavioral psychology. Now, a few people have used the term propaganda, they say that what we\'re seeing around the psychology is propaganda. That is, that\'s true. But we\'ve got to go deeper. And we\'ve actually got to be considering that the British government and this is this extends worldwide but if I just focus on the UK at the moment, we\'re talking about the use of psychology on the wider public but also on people in positions of authority. So within the local government councils in UK, within the police within education, even the members of parliament themselves have been subjected to this very pernicious applied behavioral psychology. Now, the oranges of this go back many, many years, we can go back to Tavistock, the Tavistock Institute, the Frankfurt School even, we can be looking into the 1930s 1940s. But essentially the period where we began to see this on the rise, we\'re looking around about the year 2000 when we started to see people coming close to British government, in order to advise them on how to use psychology to get political agendas through. And interestingly the first department it affected was the Department for environment and Rural Affairs. That was when we had another so called pandemic of foot and mouth. 11 million animals very cruelly killed.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> But the Behavioural Insights Team inside that department spread across government became the Behavioural Insights Team alongside the Cabinet Office in UK. And then what have we seen over recent years, we\'ve seen the experts inside that bit team behavioral insight team, working with, amongst others, the French. And we particularly tracked a gentleman called Olivier earlier, who was part of salt cozies inner circle. And there were a number of meetings set up where British and French experts met to join to discuss how they were going to get applied behavioral psychology working both in the UK and in France. Now, where does that take us? That takes us to the fact that we can now show we can prove there\'s no theory here, that the Applied Psychology has been brought directly into all matters to do with COVID. And the vaccine. And the worst example I can give our audience today is the minutes from 22nd of March last year from the government scientific team called the sage team in which they were discussing using fear using stress and anxiety in order to get people in the UK to adhere more to the government\'s COVID-19 policies. So they were going to use fear. And they were also going to turn community members against each other in order to use the community relationships for people to police each other, either by encouragement or by criticism. So that is the situation as we speak in UK, Applied Psychology, the public completely unaware of it, the British government boasting that it can change the way people think, without them understanding what\'s happening. It even says in its 2010 document mindspace people may know their behavior is being changed, but they won\'t know how we\'re if they realize it\'s being changed, they still won\'t fully understand how it was done. This is now expanded across Europe, and the technologies been sold to the US and Australia. This is the danger not just COVID and vaccination, but applied political psychology alongside it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Thank you very much, Brian. Let\'s turn now to Professor mind. Your perspective as someone looking at this from the academic and the research side from the University.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> I\'m delighted to be here, and especially delighted with the title of this panel. Again, the matrix is a title of my new book published last week. So it\'s the right place to be for today. I have just two points. First, why did state and commercial media defines the reality of the pandemic, not alternative media? And second, why do we not have any false state journalism beyond independent platforms like UK column, vida journalists follow governments using Applied Psychology this was a binds point point right now, my first points in media reality of the pandemic. The traditional media BBC, for example, as a memory of society, the shared backhaul knowledge. Alternative Media, like UK column are not part of CES knowledge, even this conference will not become part of it.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> That means nobody has to care what we talk about here as long as we not reach the level of key media, like BBC of traditional media. Using King media people observe power relations, who has the power to define reality, with the power to shape society\'s knowledge. So people don\'t have to believe in key media reality is enough to believe in key media effects. In my academic discipline and communication, we talk about influence of presumed influence, influence of presumed influence. This concept has three pillars first, people know that everybody else knows about media reality, knowledge of society. Second, people believe in media effects and serve because of one and two people adapt to King media\'s reality. That\'s what we could observe in the corner cases. In Germany we had and we have a very uniform reporting in the key media. It\'s all about the killer viral story. Some critics say we would have no pandemic without the tests, I say we would have no pandemic</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Make this key media journalists doing their job. The job of journalism is not to promote government policy. Quite the opposite.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> By the journalism fair, my second point it\'s I think it\'s all about dependencies about economic and political dependencies. He media are among the winners of the pandemic. First, they got new financial resources, state subsidies and Romney paid ads, lots of ex pregnancy audience came back. In an age of fear and anxiety. People seek safety in official holds official knowledge in official news. And last but not least, as a government\'s help to fight challenges, especially alternative media, blocking channels, deleting videos, freezing bank accounts, observing free and independent journalists via the Secret Service, source and power started the kind of cyber war in order to suppress all non hegemonic information. And in this work, he media a very powerful ally. The lessons that we have to have to learn this is my final sentence is quite simple. We need media without commercial and political dependencies are nonprofit organizations with transparency, the social monitoring is a different media ethics. It\'s a long way, of course, and I think we have to start the public debate on media ownership as a today\'s and tomorrow\'s. Thank you.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Thank you. That\'s a book I\'m ordering. That Frick. Thank you. Thank you, Katherine. Just to follow on from what my other panel colleagues said, I\'d like to comment on the coordinated fashion of, of the propaganda that we were witnessing, it\'s coordinated globally. The streamlining of the messaging, even the policy itself, the attacks against dissenters, the fact checkers that have been deployed the deep platforming, by Silicon Valley by big tech. This is like a war effort, and it\'s in its global context is totally unprecedented in history, even to the point now, where the media is working with government institutions to effectively single out and marginalize, quote, anti vaxxers as a kind of crude pejorative term, in particularly vicious fashion. So what started off as ostensibly a sales and marketing campaign for the transnational pharmaceutical, industry or cartel, if you will, has accelerated into something much more pernicious. And, you know, accusing, for instance accusing the quote unvaccinated as being akin to murders as the US President Joe Biden had recently said in commented, the or California Governor Gavin Newsom, comparing the unvaccinated to drunk drivers as a public health hazard. So this is the sort of hyperbolic language that\'s being effectively weaponized. Through propaganda from the government media complex, I say government media complex, because these two institutions are working hand in glove and across borders now. And they\'ve effectively polarized society in recent months. And at worse, the segregating a minority in a manner reminiscent of some of the worst periods of recent history, particularly mid 20th century, Germany, as an example, or in a sectarian country as extreme sectarian or tribal divides. So throughout this shameful saga, the mainstream media has been an enabler and has shown little restraint in attacking those who are considered dissident to government policy. So by combining forces directly between government and the press, the fourth estate has effectively become a fifth column, which is being weaponized against against the people themselves. And if you want to look at the actual data of this, it\'s very clear now, the the drop in advertising just in the UK alone, during the first lockdown, something like a loss of 1.1 billion pounds in advertising spend across all the major industries. And that was really picked up by the government itself, who then became the biggest advertiser. As Michael has commented previously, during that period, almost 50% more than the next biggest corporate spender, which was Unilever.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Corporation. And so in addition to this, this was a effectively propaganda campaigns paid for by the government subsidizing all of the mainstream media, mainstream corporate media outlets. And the government struck a 119 million pound deal for COVID advertising weeks before the first lockdown. That\'s according to the UK Daily Telegraph newspaper, that was reported in October of 2020. So there was an advanced plan, if you will, to roll out this propaganda, which as Brian garish, previously commented is, is predicated on weaponized applied behavioral psychology. So, UK Government pandemic advertising in 2020, alone, it tops a quarter of a billion pounds. So this is not these are not trivial sums of money, and some of the worst type of propaganda you\'ve ever seen a very manipulative, definitely attacking the disposition of members of the public, coordinated across every outlet. In terms of messaging, you can just look at a few examples, pick out any day of the year, and you\'ll see completely streamline messaging across all media outlets. The public has never had to face anything like this in history, not in the West, anyway. And to top it off, if you want to look at the civil society sector, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Corporation.

The public has never had to face anything like this in history, not in the West, anyway. And to top it off, if you want to look at the civil society sector, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, up to June 2020. And ploughed something like $250 million in foundation grants into mainstream media outlets, like the BBC, NBC AlJazeera, pro publica, The Guardian Univision, financial times the Atlantic just to name only a few. So this adds another feature to the propaganda rollout, the complete coordination and this is the same Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that is subsidizing the r&d for the vaccine development. And has marshaled one particular project, I believe that\'s the Oxford vaccine or the AstraZeneca vaccine, but is subsidizing effectively global manufacturing. So there, there is a conflict of interest there on a level that is even on comprehensible. And just to round this off, this crisis is being articulated in a national security context, more and more now we hear the rhetoric. So it\'s worth pointing out that the g7 nations in June of 2018, had initiated what is called the rapid response mechanism, the RRM. And this is an agreement between all g7 nations that they will be of single mind that there\'ll be a single messaging in any particular crisis, that there will be no variations from their agreed narrative. This is the rapid response mechanism. This was initiated by then Prime Minister Theresa May, and this is covering the g7 nations, this is initially said to counter Russian disinformation at the time or enemy disinformation or propaganda. But now we can see that this is exactly what has happened throughout the duration of the COVID crisis. So that that brings it into a geopolitical context to show the level of coordination is unprecedented. And it\'s global. In that respect.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Patrick, thank you, they always say follow the money. What we heard yesterday, again, was this notion of plans being made well before the beginning of the pandemic, and in many different fields. So these are serious questions about the propaganda matrix. So now Taylor return to you. Take it away.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Thank you for having me. It\'s a pleasure to be here. Now, it is, of course, the role of the media to hold power to account and to hold the establishment to account. And unfortunately, what we are seeing here with this covid 19 crisis is that the media in particular, the mainstream media is doing the groundwork and the PR for the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the corrupt public health industry. And what I find extremely problematic here is that, as we all know, sitting here on this panel, it is our job as media professionals to basically inform the public and our duty is to the public. Instead, our associates I guess, in the mainstream media are encouraging people to make an irreversible health decision, and they\'re only providing them certain types of information in one side of the story here. And so that\'s why it is so important that independent media really plays a strong role.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And uplifting the voices of the doctors who are part of say doctors for COVID ethics and those who are speaking out. And I\'ll get to that in just a little bit here. But we know that the propaganda is unfortunately quite effective. One thing to remember is that just a year and a half ago, we did not know the terms PCR test or flatten the curve or social distancing. So we see these public health terms and phrases being used in everyday vernacular, again, pointing to how strong this propaganda is.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And of course, the media has been instilling fear in the public, and the media propaganda has also caused people to become fearful of one another, and to also police each other. This is very problematic as it is very reminiscent of what we have seen in the past with totalitarian regimes, and also to it creates a social hierarchy. as Patrick henningsen was saying, the mainstream media is demonizing unvaccinated people blaming the so called surgeon COVID cases and hospitalizations on unvaccinated people. And essentially, those who are vaccinated are becoming fearful of those who choose not to get the job. So we\'re seeing this division. And it\'s important to also remember that the establishment benefits from our division.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> And again, I\'m sorry.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Okay. And again, I want to also emphasize the importance of the doctors who we have really relied on here to provide us with the facts and the science and the truth when it comes to COVID-19. The vaccines and this particular virus, because many of them are demonized in the media. And it reminds me of many of the whistleblowers who speak out john Kiriakou spoke out against the CIA and so many others. And what happens to them is that they are demonized, they are smeared and it comes to a great risk to not only their careers and their personal lives, to speak out and provide us with the truth. So I do want to thank the doctors and medical professionals associated with doctors for COVID ethics, it\'s been my pleasure to work alongside all of you. And I could tell you that each week, each of these doctors are risking so much again to provide us with the truth and the facts here. And again, it\'s been my pleasure to be a part of this. And I just would encourage everybody that\'s independent media is the future. So that\'s the positive here. More and more people are turning away from the mainstream media, the viewership has declined quite significantly over the past 10 years. And specifically, within the past five years, people are also turning to social media to receive their news, which does somewhat tie into independent media. But again, it goes back to the funding model, independent media is funded by viewers Well, the establishment media, mainstream media is funded by the very people that they are meant to hold to account. So I think that the future can look bright if we put more of a focus on independent media, and also more importantly, uplift the voices of the brave men and women in the medical profession who have spoken out against this medical tyranny.</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> So that leads right into my first question, and I\'m gonna throw this out for response, raise your hand if you want to go and I\'ll acknowledge you. So Professor myon said that the I forget your exact words, but that our reality matrix is being is being created by the propaganda matrix, not by independent media. So if independent media is going to get back in the game, what is it we can do to better serve our audience and help them transform away from the situation and the tyranny that is threatening all of us?</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> Anyone who wants to take that? Patrick?</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> I\'ll have a stab at that. You have to Katherine, that\'s a that\'s a really difficult question. You know, one of the big fundamental problems with the current situation, in terms of social media platforms dominating and hoovering up a large percentage of the online traffic is while the mainstream media why governments are seem to be, you know, seem to be rooting out this scourge of disinformation, as they call it, or misinformation, as YouTube, and Google often referred to it or Facebook, there is a lot of misinformation that is circulating even in alternative media, in on social media as well to just to add a little more complication to the mix. So within the independent media, there\'s that problem that people have to contend with as well. But I think people our viewers are more discerning than ever. And this this crisis has forced a lot of people in in many ways is raised</p><p class="serif lh-lg"> The standard of analysis, a recent MIT report where they sent undercover researchers into the quote, alternative media found that there\'s a higher standard of data integrity. And following the facts within the quote, skeptics community, as they, as they said, is opposed to what they would call the mainstream audiences. So that\'s definitely a positive development. So in many ways, people are being forced to be more discerning and to raise their game. So that to me is very promising. And it only means that things are going to open up more and more in the independence sphere and more quality content, hopefully is going to move into that, that space as well.</p>',
